| An infinite canvas where you can explore articles as a graph | [Kamal Kamalaldin](http://linkedin.com/in/kkamalaldin/) | Understanding user behavior and the recommendation engines/standards The Atlantic uses. It would be helpful to know if The Atlantic archive includes tags/summaries of each article. |
| Add SAT/GRE-style reading comprehension questions next to articles. 1\. Students can use this as a fun way to test prep while learning about current events2\. The Atlantic can use test scores to gather insights such as   (a) Literacy rates of readers  (b) Monitoring for how effectively authorial intent was communicated | [Billy Zhou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/billyzzh/) | For MVP purposes, I can just make this a Chrome extension. But I’m curious if there are existing  repositories that I should extend instead.  Basic understanding of The Atlantic’s existing architecture for monitoring user behavior  |
| Problem: Readers can’t easily follow their curiosity within an article, and linear content discovery tools often force them to leave the site to explore related ideas. Idea: A tool that allows readers to explore specific article excerpts to discover related coverage across The Atlantic’s archive, surfacing deeper context tied to what they find most interesting. | [Aaron Boorstein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-boorstein/) | I’m looking for an experienced technical collaborator to help prototype this tool. I bring journalism experience as a published journalist and active freelancer, along with UX/UI design experience. |
| Problem: Perceived or real, journalism doesn’t feel accessible to many people, partly due to a feeling of intimidation from content presented at an assumed level of understanding.  Idea: Don’t “dumb down” content, but build an **AI “knowledge gauge”** that lets people dial up or dial down explainer content (presented in subtitles, pop-ups, etc.) that accompanies the original content. The gauge could be based on reading levels or comprehension levels, if not actually labeled that way. A person could start at one level and notch up or down levels until they get to a comfortable, understandable pace. (Note: This would be using AI as a feature that could be applied to existing digital journalism products, but I also have an idea for a media product  that this could be initially applied to as part of a participatory educational/entertainment experience. Based on interest from others, we could build out just the gauge or also the framework of the media entity it could be used in). | [Dave Watson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daverwatson/); davewattage@gmail.com | While I have been an enthusiastic adopter of AI tools to build basic apps and conduct research, my background is not technical. I would love to partner with one or more people who can help bring a creative/content framework to life as an MVP using the Atlantic resources and other available tools. |

| Problem: While explainer articles are declining in demand, readers and young people in particular do need to know the context of current events and how we have gotten where we are.   Idea: Automatically generated timeline feature, patching together chronologically the events that have led to today's events. Make it possible to hover over to get a brief snippet explaining how it connects to today, and to click through to historical articles. | [Jonathan Bash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jtbash/) | My background is PR, public affairs and political consulting and I’m the CEO & Co-Founder of Locunity, an AI-powered platform for civic news and local community/gov relations. We cover every public meeting (city council, etc.) so you don’t have to. | Since I am non-technical, I will be mostly vibe-coding. Happy to partner with a technical person who is interested in the Timeline feature or public meetings in general, so that we can geek out. |
| Problem: readers can lose track of particular issues or topics over time, such as due to changes in the news cycle. Not only might they need to catch up, but also keep track of any new developments. Idea: use the archive to find any background to a story, offering an immediate catch-up/background, and let the readers mark that story & thread to follow for them. If new closely related stories are found, the reader is notified or the story is pinned for them the next time they visit. | [Matthew Crossman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattcrossman/) | I’m technical but would like other collaborators, including any journalists and people who have a good understanding of how people consume media. |
| Problem: Ongoing need to drive subscriptions and retain subscribers. Idea: Under the personalization category, how about creating a content optimization system based on Yahoo’s successful CORE algo (\~30% performance lift)  that is a lighter, smarter, editorially aligned version that plays to The Atlantic’s strengths? It would be run by editors and stay true to their editorial voice while optimizing the top content modules for the following:  Driving subscriptions Subscriber retention Article completion Time spent Return frequency I used ChatGPT to briefly explore this concept; [a deeper description is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i-j9l2Y2xErh6JSTXYNUz_S3gFeWKTbOC_blYcjGnxs/edit?usp=sharing), with background at the top and implementation recommendations starting about half way down. (Of course the AI thinks it’s a great idea, but let’s take that with a big ol’ grain of salt.) It involves multi-armed bandits handling multi-objective rewards, with a relatively low (5-10%) exploration rate. Chat GPT outlined one possible approach to a module (see bottom of doc). I’m not a fan of this exact approach, but curious if this is something The Atlantic would be interested in discussing. The tech could also be used to optimize newsletters. Similarly, Claude says this is easy to do with AI, but recommends only light optimization, in keeping with the Atlantic’s editorial strengths. **Key Features of This Approach: 70% editorial control** preserved (editors still curate hero stories and featured content) **Quality over clicks** \- optimizes for subscriber retention, not CTR **Transparent and privacy-respecting** \- users can see and control their data **Gradual implementation** \- 6-month phased rollout starting with simple features **Modern AI advantages** \- uses semantic embeddings instead of keyword matching | [Liz Lufkin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lizlufkin) (editorial lead on the Yahoo’s CORE team) | One engineer? Take a look at [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i-j9l2Y2xErh6JSTXYNUz_S3gFeWKTbOC_blYcjGnxs/edit?tab=t.0), and you tell me\!  |
| Offshoot from Billy Zhou’s idea \-  Problem \- There is no way to measure where an author’s intended meaning diverges from how readers actually interpret claims, causality, or intent in otherwise accurate text. Idea \-  Build a system that probes reader interpretations before and after a small text change (eg \- counterexample) to identify which parts of the text produce misreadings. | Roddsi Sarkar | My background is a mix of early career dabbling in coding and analytics with product management being my primary career. Would like to team up with a technical person.  |
| Reader Participation as a Trust Engine **Problem:** Journalists can't be experts in everything they cover, and readers with genuine expertise have no structured way to contribute their knowledge. Comment sections, when they do exist, can be noisy and adversarial (The Atlantic doesn’t have one). **Idea:** Build a system that lets readers with relevant firsthand expertise (doctors, engineers, locals, practitioners) flag specific claims they can verify, contest, or add context to. Not a comment section—a structured input where they identify their basis for knowledge and point to specific passages. Moderated and surfaced transparently alongside the article. Turns the audience into an engaged trust asset rather than just passive consumers.  **Why this would work:** Readers like participating in the conversation.. LLMs make it feasible to surface trusted voices by triaging incoming reader submissions, flagging low-quality or bad-faith contributions, and helping moderators surface the signal from the noise at scale. | [Mia Wu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mia-wu-16b9a61a1/) | A technical collaborator, and someone with editorial experience to help think through moderation policies. |
| Problem (thinking out loud)- Readers often engage with specific arguments made in articles. The Atlantic archive allows navigation article by article, making it hard to follow the argument trail over years. With debates and discussions, nuance is lost and the context collapses.  Idea \- Build an interaction layer for the Atlantic Archive that will let readers explore how a specific argument has been framed, counter challenged and evolved over time. Ideally, it is moving away from search query (matching that argument to other such keywords/topic similarity)  to a structured object (understand the passage’s role in the context and then search for that kind of idea). Why now? \- Most discussions originate from a quote or a highlighted phrase within an article. Also, technological advances help in structured retrieval and language models make it possible to go beyond tokenization and token based search. This creates an opportunity to expand how readers interact with content. .   | Roddsi Sarkar | I plan to use Infactory ai. Would like to collaborate with a technical person.  |
| **Problem**: Reporters are time-strapped and resource-strapped to produce accurate and indepth content in a 24-hour news cycle. There is immediate demand for interpretation, at least by engaged audiences. A wealth of knowledge sits in news archives but each story is reported in a moment in time and simple knowledge retrieval doesn’t surface insights fast enough, given the above context. **Solution**\- **a**) leverage LLMs to produce a knowledge graph based on a news outlet’s existing coverage. LLM’s can scale processes which would normally require a librarian and time to create/update a knowledge graph. **b**) connect this knowledge graph to an AI chatbot that uses another LLM and a graph-search tool. This should create an on-demand ‘reference copilot’ for reporters to leverage context and smart associations via the knowledge graph, to solve the problems above. | [Chris Young](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisiyoung), ex-journalist, current tech product manager | For the Hackathon, is there an API or MCP server we can call to get archived content? |
