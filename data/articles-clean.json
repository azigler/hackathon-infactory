    "content":"So, should we Lebowski, or should we not Lebowski? I asked my friend Alex as we finished our pizza and wine on a recent evening. I felt like I was asking her if she wanted to make out. The Big Lebowski—the 1998 Coen brothers movie about bowling, pot, and mistaken identity—is one of my favorites, and I was nervous about introducing it to her. I like to use Lebowski quotes as a way to assert myself while, like Jeff Bridges's character, the Dude, not taking things too seriously. There's a Lebowski ism for virtually every tricky situation: Asked to work on a Saturday? I don't roll on Shabbas. Someone does something outrageous? This is not 'Nam There are rules! Disagree about something? That's just, like, your opinion, man. Whenever life has been especially difficult, I've returned to the movie and found solace in its whatever, man ethos. When I was addled by postpartum depression and my baby would cry nonstop, I would watch Lebowski clips on YouTube and savor a rare laugh. But it's a strange movie, and I have known Alex for only a couple of years. I was worried that she would dislike it so much that she would kind of dislike me too, through osmosis. Or that I would realize that we have completely different senses of humor, and that perhaps we aren't very close after all. In Lebowski terms, would our friendship abide? Or would we be out of our element? Jitters such as these are rather common. If something really matters to you, Beverley Fehr, a University of Winnipeg psychologist, told me, there's a vulnerability in sharing it with someone else. When we declare a favorite book, movie, or album and introduce it to others, Jeffrey Hall, a communications studies professor at the University of Kansas, told me, what we're doing is saying, This is an aspect of my identity that I'm willingly putting out there in order for other people to know me. And if you reject this thing, you reject me.' Tom Vanderbilt, the author of You May Also Like, said that recommending something to someone can be like giving a gift, in that it says something about you, but you're also trying to anticipate what they might like. Read: What's really behind the cult of Labubu Often, our friends will like what we like: Several researchers told me that most people's friends are extremely similar to them in terms of age, education level, political attitudes, and leisure pursuits. These similarities tend to include cultural tastes. Researchers who have shown groups of people clips of, say, Food, Inc. and America's Funniest Home Videos have found that people whose brains responded similarly were more likely to become and stay friends. We tend to like people who like the same things as us because they validate our view of the world: I must be right because there's this other person who sees it exactly the same way is how Fehr explained this (largely subconscious) line of thinking to me. And then, once people become friends, they tend to conform to each other's tastes and preferences. If they like it, we must like it, too—after all, we're so similar! The trouble is, Fehr told me, we usually want our friends to be even more similar to us than they actually are. When we're presenting something to a friend and we don't know if the friend will see it the same way we do, she said, one of the fears is that we're going to realize that we aren't as similar as we thought we were. Fehr once had a group of friends over to watch Nebraska, a movie she loved, and remembers not getting too much of a reaction to it. This kind of letdown can be a threat to your perception of the friendship: Do you not know them as well as you thought you did? Fehr remembers feeling a little hurt, before eventually letting it go. But she hasn't planned another movie night with that friend group since. If a friend doesn't love our favorite cultural artifact, we might try to resolve the resulting discomfort in a few ways. We might change our own minds about it, telling ourselves Nebraska's not that great after all; we might try changing their minds about it; or, potentially, we might change the way we think about the friendship, Angela Bahns, a psychologist at Wellesley College, told me. Whether a disagreement over a beloved book or movie sparks friction in the friendship, Bahns said, depends on how well you know the friend; what else you have in common; and how important that particular book, movie, or show is to you. Sometimes, this kind of difference can cause an unexpected level of tension: When Lidia Wiens, a 39 year old in Seattle, invited her friend Julia over to watch her favorite movie, Sleepless in Seattle, she thought Julia, an agreeable woman with whom she shared similar taste, would love it. But to her dismay, she noticed that Julia was looking at her phone a lot, and occasionally, Julia would make negative comments about the characters. Wiens felt awkward, and the two had a bit of a fight about it. They both ultimately apologized, but Wiens thinks that in the future, she won't put so much emotional stock in sharing her favorite books and movies with other people. I don't know why it became so personal, Wiens told me. She felt like she wanted her friend's genuine response to the movie, but she also wanted the genuine response to be a positive one. Read: I see your smartphone addicted life As for me, good news: Alex agreed to Lebowski! But I didn't get any less nervous as the movie staggered through its plot, such as it is. At the time of Lebowski's release, The Guardian called the film a bunch of ideas shoveled into a bag and allowed to spill out at random, and I was finding it hard to refute that assessment. In the movie, a burnout named Jeffrey the Dude Lebowski is hired by a millionaire with the same name to rescue his kidnapped wife. Hijinks ensue when the Dude's best friend hatches a plan to keep the wealthier Lebowski's ransom money for the Dude and himself. It also features a group of nihilists, a porn kingpin, a bowling competition, and a storyline about the millionaire's adult daughter's quest to get pregnant. Actually, I wondered as Alex and I shared a bag of popcorn, why are there so many characters? Is this even a good movie? I grew irritated by its gratuitousness, as exemplified by a scene in which a topless woman bounces on a trampoline outside the porn kingpin's house. I wasn't sure how to wordlessly impart to Alex that this isn't the kind of thing that I, a nice suburban mom, would condone. Alex didn't seem to laugh much, and I paused the movie several times to reassure her that we didn't have to finish it if she didn't want to. When it ended, I quickly noted how tired I was, and that she must be, too, giving her a chance to make a quick exit without a lot of commentary. Which she did. Lebowski's not for everyone, and that's okay, I tried to reassure myself as I padded upstairs to bed. But my worries about whether she at least mildly appreciated my weird little comfort watch were resolved a few days later. I brought in the mail to find that she had sent me a onesie for my son, emblazoned with the words little Lebowski urban achievers. We did abide, after all."

    "content":"Eighty Years on the Edge In the August issue, Atlantic contributors examined the past eight decades of life in the Atomic Age. Thank you for your series of articles on nuclear warfare. I was especially moved by the essays on Japanese internment and Kurt Vonnegut, but all of them led me to wonder why we humans seem so incapable of learning from the past. Noah Hawley was correct to note that our current age is rife with innovations that are technically sweet but have rarely been subjected to the question Just because we can, should we? I wonder what Vonnegut would say if he were alive today. Ellen Vliet Cohen Arlington, Mass. One question is not answered in The Atlantic's August issue: What can really be done to rid the world of nuclear weapons? Perhaps it is time that this topic reentered public discussion. My proposal is that the 186 countries that don't have nuclear weapons assemble and draft an ultimatum to the countries that do, stating that unless the nuclear armed states get rid of their weapons, they, the non nuclear armed states, will band together to conduct the research and development necessary for each of them to have their own weapons. That's it. Risky? Yes. But is it riskier than the present situation? Perhaps not. Ross Andersen, in The New Arms Race, predicts that the nuclear club may double under existing conditions. Staying on the present course assures us of only one thing: that we will eventually, by intention, misjudgment, human or technological error, or just plain bad luck accomplish our mutual assured destruction. The ultimatum risks nothing more than that. Red Slider Sacramento, Calif. How can I describe the feeling I had when I turned to The Light of a Man Made Star and saw the photographs from Michael Light's 100 Suns? First among them is a photograph of the Hood test, to which I, as a small child, was exposed. My father, a mineral exploration geologist interested in uranium, had brought my brother, mother, and me to Nevada that summer. I was young, and my memories of that time are few: lifting my pillow off the floor in the bunkhouse to expose a rattlesnake, the ghostly rise and fall of a player piano's keys. Years later, many residents of the area contracted cancer from the fallout. Danger, secrecy, and the unnatural—these were the hallmarks of my own private nuclear age. The following year, in 1958, my father went to work on a feasibility study for Project Chariot, to determine whether the government should use nuclear devices to bomb a harbor into the coast of northwestern Alaska. The project was classified, and he didn't speak of it until the year I turned 12, when I accidentally discovered a book length document titled The Effects of Nuclear Weapons in our bookcase. The chapter that I most remember was titled Effects on Personnel. It contained photographs of hibakusha—Japanese atomic bomb survivors—with their bodies exposed to display the kimono patterns that had been burned into their backs. I've never shaken these images from my mind, or forgotten that those photographed were treated in the text not as victims but as subjects of an experiment. My father continued to prospect in Alaska for radioactive minerals. The summer before the Cuban missile crisis, he found a large deposit of beryllium, an element crucial to the workings of nuclear weapons; it earned him a write up in Newsweek and a citation from the Alaska legislature. I grew up to become an English professor, and I taught Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle in a course on nuclear issues that I developed in the early 2000s. Vonnegut's portrayal of Felix Hoenikker struck close to home. Alison Sainsbury Bloomington, Ill. I read Damn You All to Hell!, Tom Nichols's article discussing films about nuclear war, with interest. He left out an obscure contribution to the genre: In 1964, Rod Serling wrote a TV movie starring Peter Sellers, Carol for Another Christmas, which portrayed a nightmarish future of nuclear destruction. My father was active in groups that urged a nuclear test ban treaty. He was so impressed with the movie that he bought a copy, got a projector and a screen, and went around Chicago showing it to anybody who would watch. I was a teenager and it frightened me—it seemed that we were all doomed to die in nuclear war. The movie remains worth a watch today. Judith Jacobson Baltimore, Md. I appreciated Damn You All to Hell! and could relate to Tom Nichols's anecdote about teaching today's students about nuclear war. After 23 years on active duty in the Army, I also went into academia, teaching courses in political science and intelligence studies. When I first taught a class on homeland security, I shared videos of duck and cover drills and received similarly incredulous reactions from my students, who after 9\/11 were living with the threat of terrorism—not nuclear war. At one of the colleges where I taught, I had a colleague who owned a home with a fallout shelter constructed in the 1960s. I took students to see it so they could imagine what it would have been like to actually live there. It wasn't until I showed them the 1999 movie Blast From the Past, however, that they fully grasped what a fallout shelter would have to look like for a family to survive a nuclear war. Richard Kilroy Charlottesville, Va. Eleven years ago, I visited Manzanar with my wife, never having known that such a place existed. We were told that the word manzanar means apple orchard in Spanish, because the land where the internment site stood had originally been an apple orchard. Now, we discovered, it was a national historic site. Trying to imagine life in the prison camp was impossible. We couldn't visualize how families had been ripped from their homes and crammed into barracks surrounded by guard towers and barbed wire. Our visit ended in Manzanar's cemetery, which people still visit to see the graves of their ancestors. What we did not hear or see were the firsthand stories of the people who lived there. Andrew Aoyama's The Expatriate, about Joseph Kurihara, was an article we needed to read, even 11 years later. Richard Grove Philadelphia, Pa. I appreciated Jeffrey Goldberg's article, Nuclear Roulette, which quotes me in its last sentence: Most of all, we forget the rule articulated by the mathematician and cryptologist Martin Hellman: that the only way to survive Russian roulette is to stop playing. Society neglects the nuclear threat at its peril. If we would honestly face that threat—and others, such as climate change—they could transform into opportunities to finally build the more peaceful, cooperative world we have dreamed of for ages, but thought ourselves incapable of achieving. To quote a paper I wrote some years ago, Technology has given a new, global meaning to the Biblical injunction: I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life that you and your descendants may live.' Martin E. Hellman Stanford, Calif. Behind the Cover In this month's cover story, How Originalism Killed the Constitution, Jill Lepore considers why the process of constitutional amendment has all but vanished from American politics. The Framers designed the Constitution to be adaptable, Lepore argues, but a conservative legal philosophy has undermined attempts to change it. For our cover design, the calligraphers Sean Freeman and Eve Steben of There Is Studio wrote out the headline and subheadline using fountain pens and traditional brushes, their tapered strokes evoking the lettering of the Constitution's preamble. ' Liz Hart, Art Director Corrections The New Arms Race (August) stated that Japan's centrifuge program reprocesses nuclear waste into plutonium. In fact, this process occurs in separate waste reprocessing plants. The Judgments of Muriel Spark (September) stated that T. S. Eliot converted to Catholicism. In fact, he converted to Anglo Catholicism. This article appears in the October 2025 print edition with the headline The Commons.

    "content":"A bushy browed, pipe smoking, piano playing Antonin Scalia—Nino—the scourge of the left, knew how to work a crowd. He loved opera; he loved theater; he loved show tunes. In high school, he played the lead role in Macbeth: I have no spur to prick the sides of my intent, but only vaulting ambition. As clever as he was combative, Scalia, short and stocky, was known, too, for his slightly terrifying energy and for his eviscerating sense of humor. He fished and hunted: turkeys and ducks, deer and boar, alligators. He loved nothing better than a dictionary. He argued to win. He was one of the Supreme Court's sharpest writers and among its severest critics. It's hard to get it right, he'd tell his clerks, sending back their drafts; they had that engraved on a plaque. Few justices have done more to transform American jurisprudence, not only from the bench but also from the seminar table, the lecture hall, and the eerie velveteen intimacy of the television stage. He gave one speech so often that he kept its outline, scribbled on a scrap of paper, tucked in his suit pocket. The Constitution is not a living document, he'd say. It's dead. Dead, dead, dead! Two hundred and fifty years after Americans declared independence from Britain and began writing the first state constitutions, it's not the Constitution that's dead. It's the idea of amending it. The whole purpose of the Constitution, Scalia once said, is to prevent a future society from doing what it wants to do. This is not true. One of the Constitution's founding purposes was to prevent change. But another was to allow for change without violence. Amendment is a constitution's mechanism for the prevention of insurrection—the only way to change the fundamentals of government without recourse to rebellion. Amendment is so essential to the American constitutional tradition—so methodical and so entirely a conception of endurance through adaptation—that it can best be described as a philosophy. It is, at this point, a philosophy all but forgotten. The philosophy of amendment is foundational to modern constitutionalism. It has structured American constitutional and political development for more than two centuries. It has done so in a distinctive, halting pattern of progression and regression: Constitutional change by way of formal amendment has alternated with judicial interpretation, in the form of opinions issued by the U.S. Supreme Court, as a means of constitutional revision. This pattern has many times provided political stability, with formal amendment and judicial interpretation as the warp and weft of a sturdily woven if by now fraying and faded constitutional fabric. But the pattern, which features, at regular intervals, the perception by half the country that the Supreme Court has usurped the power of amendment, has also led to the underdevelopment of the Constitution, weakened the idea of representative government, and increased the polarization of American politics—ultimately contributing, most lately, to the rise of a political style that can only be called insurrectionary. The U.S. Constitution has one of the lowest amendment rates in the world. Some 12,000 amendments have been formally introduced on the floor of Congress; only 27 have ever been ratified, and there has been no significant amendment in more than 50 years. That is not because Americans are opposed to amending constitutions. Since 1789, Americans have submitted at least 10,000 petitions and countless letters, postcards, and phone and email messages to Congress regarding constitutional amendments, and they have introduced and agitated for thousands more amendments in the pages of newspapers and pamphlets, from pulpits, at political rallies, on websites, and all over social media. Every state has its own constitution, and all of them have been frequently revised and replaced. One delegate to a 19th century constitutional convention in Missouri suggested that a state constitution ought to be rewritten every 14 years on the theory that every seven years, every bone, muscle, tissue, fibre and nerve matter—every cell in the human body—is replaced, and surely, in twice that time, every constitution ought to be amended too. Since 1776, the states have held some 250 constitutional conventions and adopted 144 constitutions, or about three per state. Every state constitution currently in place has an amendment provision. For most of American history, the states have been exceptionally busy holding constitutional conventions, but as with amending the U.S. Constitution, the practice has stagnated. (No state has held a full dress convention since Rhode Island did in 1986.) Nevertheless, the practice of amendment by popular vote thrives in the states, where constitutional revision is exponentially easier to achieve. Since 1789, some 7,000 amendments formally proposed in the states have been ratified, more than two thirds of those introduced. Article V, the amendment provision of the U.S. Constitution, is a sleeping giant. It sleeps until it wakes. War is, very often, what wakes it up. And then it roars. In 1789, in the aftermath of the Revolutionary War, Congress passed 12 amendments, 10 of which, later known as the Bill of Rights, were ratified by the states by 1791. A federal amendment requires a double supermajority to become law: It must pass by a two thirds vote in both houses of Congress (or be proposed by two thirds of the states), and then it must be ratified by three quarters of the states (either in legislatures or at conventions). No amendments were ratified in the 61 years from 1804 to 1865, and then, at the end of the Civil War, three were ratified in five years. What became the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865, abolishing slavery, had first been proposed decades earlier. No amendments were ratified in the 43 years from 1870 to 1913, and then, around the time of the First World War, four were ratified in seven years. The Nineteenth Amendment, granting women the right to vote and first called for in 1848, was ratified in 1920, after a 72 year moral crusade. Again, the giant slept. In the 1930s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt largely abandoned constitutional amendment in favor of applying pressure on the Supreme Court, and the civil rights movement adopted a legal strategy that involved seeking constitutional change through the Court too. The Second World War did not awaken Article V, because mid century liberals abandoned amendment in favor of the exercise of executive and judicial power. From 1961 to 1971, as the United States became engulfed in the Vietnam War, Americans ratified four amendments and seemed very likely to ratify two more. Those that succeeded included the Twenty Fourth Amendment, which in 1964 abolished poll taxes (generally deployed to suppress the votes of the poor and especially of Black people), and the Twenty Sixth Amendment (which in 1971 lowered the voting age to 18). Both relied on a broad liberal consensus. Other efforts, such as an amendment abolishing the Electoral College, which passed the House in 1969, failed in the Senate. The Equal Rights Amendment, prohibiting the denial or abridgment of rights on the basis of sex, was introduced in Congress in 1923 and sent to the states in 1972. It fell short of the 38 states needed for ratification before the deadlines set by Congress. Liberals soon stopped proposing amendments, and amendments proposed by conservatives—providing for school prayer, banning flag burning, defining marriage, protecting fetal life, and requiring a balanced budget—all failed, leading conservatives, like earlier liberals, to instead seek constitutional change through the federal judiciary. The amending stopped. The Twenty Seventh Amendment, which concerns congressional salaries and was ratified in 1992, was one of the 12 amendments sent by Congress to the states in 1789, and then was more or less forgotten; it can hardly be said to have introduced a new idea into the Constitution. The giant has not awoken since, despite half hearted attempts to rouse it, mainly in the form of presidential political theater. Ronald Reagan supported a balanced budget amendment. Bill Clinton supported a victims' rights amendment (granting rights to victims of crime, a law and order answer to the defendants' rights movement of the 1960s), and George W. Bush called for a defense of marriage amendment (identifying marriage as between a man and a woman). Neither made any headway. Joe Biden, after stepping down from his reelection campaign in 2024, proposed a constitutional amendment to reverse the Supreme Court's decision that year granting the president considerable immunity from criminal prosecution. The giant did not wake. Between 1980 and 2020, members of Congress proposed more than 2,100 constitutional amendments. Congress, more divided with each passing year, approved none of them. In roughly that same stretch of time, state legislatures introduced almost 5,000 amendments and ratified nearly 4,000. Instead of arguing for amendments at the national level, legislators, lobbyists, and other advocates pursued different means of either securing or thwarting constitutional change: by influencing the nomination and confirmation of Supreme Court justices and by altering the method that those justices use to interpret the Constitution. The Constitution has not been meaningfully amended since 1971, right when the political parties began to polarize. Polarization would ultimately make the double supermajority requirements for amending the Constitution impossible to meet. Tellingly, 1971 marked another turning point in the history of American constitutionalism. That year, a method of constitutional interpretation that became known as originalism was put forward by a distinguished legal scholar, the Yale law professor Robert Bork. The word originalism didn't enter the English language until 1980, and it had virtually no currency before 1987, when Reagan nominated Bork to a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. The nomination was rejected. Bork maintained that the only way to read the Constitution is to determine the original intentions of its Framers and that every other method of interpretation amounts to amendment by the judiciary. Rather than Bork, it would be Scalia who brought originalism to the Court, trapping the Constitution in a wildly distorted account of the American past at a time when ordinary Americans found their ability to amend and repair a constitution to which they had supposedly given their consent entirely thwarted. Antonin Scalia, like Felix Frankfurter, came to the Court after a career primarily as a law professor. He'd been a judge for only four years; most of his published writing consisted of law review articles and speeches, not opinions from the bench. He grew up in Queens, an only child. His father was an Italian immigrant who'd become a professor of Romance languages; his mother, the daughter of Italian immigrants, taught elementary school. He inherited his first gun from his grandfather, who grew up hunting in Sicily and used to take Nino to Long Island to shoot rabbits. Scalia attended a Jesuit military school, where he was on the rifle team; he used to ride the subway from Queens to Manhattan carrying his .22 carbine target rifle. When I was growing up in New York City, people were not afraid of people with firearms, he'd say. He went to Georgetown University and then to Harvard Law School. He was a Goldwater conservative—a supporter of Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, the Republican presidential nominee, in 1964. He served in the Nixon and Ford administrations and taught law at the University of Virginia and the University of Chicago before Reagan appointed him to the D.C. Court of Appeals in 1982. Four years later, Reagan nominated him to the Supreme Court. On the first day of Scalia's confirmation hearings, in 1986, he was welcomed by the 83 year old committee chair, Strom Thurmond, a one man timeline of the political and constitutional history of the 20th century: a Democratic governor of South Carolina, the 1948 presidential candidate of the southern splinter Dixiecrat party, a drafter of the segregationist Southern Manifesto, and, in 1964, a backer of Goldwater. No one in the U.S. Senate had more fiercely fought for segregation and against civil rights. You have got a lot of children there, the senator from South Carolina said affably. I believe you have eight of them here? All nine are here, Scalia, 50, told Thurmond, beaming. I think we have a full committee. Thurmond asked Scalia about the difference between serving on a circuit court and on the Supreme Court. There's no one to correct your mistakes when you're up there, Scalia answered, except the constitutional amendment process. That process was by then no more than a chimera. The more difficult it became to amend the Constitution, the more politicized nominations to the Supreme Court became. Scalia's confirmation, though, was a breeze, partly because liberals had decided to focus their efforts on questioning the elevation of William Rehnquist to the chief justiceship, following the resignation of Warren Burger, which is what had opened up a seat for Scalia. Also: Scalia was charming. And he'd been exceptionally well briefed. Aides had peppered him with questions in practice sessions and provided memos with titles such as Likely Areas of Interest Arising Out of Your Writings, warning him, among other things, about Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that had legalized abortion: You have probably said a little more on this topic than you think. (In 1978, Scalia had said that, in his view, the courts, in cases such as Roe, had found rights where society never believed they existed.) In a typed list in Scalia's briefing packet titled Talking Points, the No. 1 topic was abortion. Scrawled below in black ink were two tips: 1. Professional, not adversarial and 2. Don't get sucked in. Thurmond, after a friendly chat with the nominee, yielded the floor to Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, who, without so much as a hello, jumped in: Kennedy: Judge Scalia, if you are confirmed, do you expect to overrule the Roe v. Wade [decision]? Scalia: Excuse me? For a long time, the overruling of Roe had appeared most likely to come in the form of a constitutional amendment. Even before the Court issued its 1973 decision, the right to life movement had worked, unsuccessfully, to defeat abortion by amending the Constitution to guarantee a right to life beginning at conception. But by the time Kennedy confronted Scalia, right to lifers had decided there was one other way to overturn Roe. In 1980, the GOP had vowed in its party platform to appoint judges at all levels of the judiciary who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life. During the confirmation hearings for John Paul Stevens in 1975—the first justice named to the Court after Roe, and by a Republican president, replacing the most liberal justice, William O. Douglas—no one asked him even a single question about the abortion decision. That changed under Reagan, who, in his two terms in office, appointed more than 400 federal judges, amounting to half the federal judiciary. All were screened for their views on abortion. (Reagan's influence on the judiciary has had a long afterlife: Supreme Court Justices John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito all worked in his administration.) Screening judges in this way was, at the time, both novel and controversial. Members of Reagan's Justice Department defended the practice by insisting that they were screening, instead, for originalism. As an assistant attorney general put it in a memo to the attorney general, The idea of original intent' must not be marketed as simply another theory of jurisprudence; rather it is an essential part of the constitutional framework of checks and balances. He emphasized that, contrary to allegations, we are not choosing judges who will impose a right wing social agenda' upon the Nation, but rather those who recognize that they, too, are bound by the Constitution. In 1981, Reagan nominated Bork to the D.C. Court of Appeals. Roe v. Wade is an unconstitutional decision, a serious and wholly unjustifiable judicial usurpation of state legislative authority, Bork had written in a statement. To opponents of abortion, Sandra Day O'Connor's Supreme Court hearings a few months later were far less reassuring. O'Connor, at 51, said she was personally opposed to abortion but then added, I am not going to be pregnant anymore, so it is perhaps easy for me to speak. This response alarmed pro lifers and greatly contributed to the movement's decision to abandon constitutional amendment in favor of influencing the judicial nomination process. The intensity of right to lifers on the issue of judicial power should not be underestimated, a Reagan adviser had reported. Republican strategists had been hoping to make the GOP the party of the pro life movement as a way to expand its base, bringing in Catholics and white evangelicals. This realignment happened very slowly. Not until 1979 were Republican members of Congress more likely to vote against abortion than Democrats. That year, Jerry Falwell helped found the Moral Majority, and a new evangelical Christian right joined the crusade against abortion. Only after Republicans in Congress began aligning with the pro life movement did the rest of the party follow, but again, they did so gradually: Republicans were more pro choice than Democrats until around 1990. And only during Reagan's presidency did this effort begin to involve attacking the legitimacy of the Court's decision in Roe. Reagan's alliance with the New Right proved crucial to his landslide reelection in 1984, after which he appointed Edwin Meese as his attorney general. Meese's Justice Department would soon fill up with young lawyers who were members of a new organization known as the Federalist Society, formed by law students at Yale (studying with Professor Bork) and the University of Chicago (studying with Professor Scalia). Keen to avoid the word conservative, they chose instead to emphasize the original intent of the Framers, and, in naming the organization, they honored both the original Federalists and a Reagan doctrine known as New Federalism, which sought to transfer power from the federal government to the states. The first meeting of the Federalist Society, at Yale in April 1982, featured 20 invited scholars and jurists, including Bork and Scalia. Some Yale law students perceived the meeting to be hostile to both reproductive rights and civil rights. A poster objecting to the symposium warned New Federalism means Old Bigotry—Support Civil Rights. The legal scholar Mary Dudziak, then a second year law student, was among those who picketed. She carried a handwritten sign with the feminist slogan If men could get pregnant, Abortion would be a sacrament. Soon after Meese took office, in 1985, he announced that the official policy of the Reagan Justice Department would be to pursue a jurisprudence of original intention as the only legitimate and properly democratic method of constitutional interpretation. Meese hired some of the founders of the Federalist Society and trained them up as a farm team (as one Meese aide later put it). He aimed to sell originalism not only to the legal community but also to the public as a form of modest and humble deference to the wisdom of the Framers, in contrast to the unrestrained imperiousness, the judicial oligarchy, of the Supreme Court. This strategy raised liberals' hackles, and it raised historians' hackles, too. Justice William Brennan, in a speech at Georgetown, called the doctrine of original intent arrogance cloaked as humility and speculated that proposals endorsing the idea must inevitably come from persons who have no familiarity with the historical record. Nothing in history is as clear as originalists pretended, and not even the most skilled historian—which justices were not—could reach such certain conclusions from such fragmented evidence. What really rankled was Meese's claim that original intent was democratic, because it was quite clear that, having failed in their efforts to amend the Constitution, conservatives had changed course, instead using judicial selection to pursue objectives they could not achieve by democratic means. The aim is now to accomplish in the courts what the Administration failed to persuade Congress to do—namely, adopt its positions on abortion, apportionment, affirmative action, school prayer and the like, a political scientist wrote in the Los Angeles Times. Nor did Meese's jurisprudence escape censure as realpolitik. Mr. Meese's version of original intent is a patent fraud on the public, the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. argued in The Wall Street Journal. The attorney general uses original intent not as a neutral principle at all but only as a means of getting certain results for the Reagan administration. He is shamelessly selective. He was also undeniably effective. Before Reagan moved into the White House, as the legal scholar Mary Ziegler has demonstrated, the pro life movement had not been especially interested in originalism, on the theory that there is no right to life in the Constitution, at least not any more than there's a right to privacy, the right cited by the Court in Roe. But after Reagan pledged to use opposition to Roe as a litmus test in appointing federal judges, litigation seemed a far better approach than amendment. In 1984, Americans United for Life held a conference under the rubric Reversing Roe v. Wade Through the Courts. Two years later, the National Abortion Rights Action League observed in a report on the Scalia and Rehnquist nominations that the pro life movement, having failed to amend the Constitution, had turned to a legislation and litigation strategy. In 1985, for its brief in Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists—concerning a Pennsylvania law that placed restrictions on abortion—the Meese Justice Department directed the acting solicitor general, Charles Fried, to ask the Court to overturn Roe and to base the government's argument on original intent; Fried obliged. (A young Samuel Alito, in the Office of Legal Counsel, who had stated his opposition to abortion in his application for the position, worked on the brief.) There is no explicit textual warrant in the Constitution for a right to an abortion, Fried's brief read. The brief elicited considerable protest, including from five former solicitors general. Only narrowly did the Supreme Court decide against overturning Roe. On June 11, 1986, the Court issued its 54 decision in Thornburgh, declaring Pennsylvania's law unconstitutional. Warren Burger, who had joined the majority in Roe, now dissented. Six days later, Burger announced that he was resigning to devote himself to the celebration of the Constitution's 1987 bicentennial. And so it came to pass that in August 1986, Antonin Scalia sat before the Senate Judiciary Committee and stumbled over Senator Kennedy's question. Excuse me? Kennedy repeated: Do you expect to overrule the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision? Scalia declined to answer. Kennedy had been questioning Scalia while waiting for the committee's ranking Democrat, Joseph R. Biden, the junior senator from Delaware, to arrive from another meeting. Biden sought a national stage, but when he got one, he often talked for too long and without making a great deal of sense. Obviously, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about, he once said in the middle of remarks at a Judiciary Committee hearing about revising the criminal code. Biden was a devout Catholic, but he was opposed to a constitutional ban on abortion. In 1983, he had considered making a play for the 1984 Democratic presidential nomination. (He would make his first bid in 1988.) As Scalia's briefing materials warned, Biden had gradually lived down his early reputation as an enfant terrible. Biden was affable—goofy, even—and willing to compromise, and Thurmond liked working with him so much that he called him my Henry Clay. Biden and Scalia had much in common: middle aged Catholic men from industrial eastern cities, with young families and thinning hair and big dreams and funny jokes, though Scalia's humor was more studied. (He once famously began an opinion with this sentence: This case, involving legal requirements for the content and labeling of meat products such as frankfurters, affords a rare opportunity to explore simultaneously both parts of Bismarck's aphorism that No man should see how laws or sausages are made.') Biden gave the judge his wide smile, told him he'd read all of his speeches that he could find, and said he was pretty darn interested in this newfound, newly enunciated doctrine of original intent. He began by asking Scalia about a speech he'd given two months earlier, at a conference hosted by Meese. Scalia had known when he delivered that speech, on June 14, that he was being considered for a position on the Court. Burger had visited the White House on May 27 to tell Reagan he intended to retire and to give him a list of possible replacements for the chief justiceship, including Scalia and Bork. By June 12, Reagan had decided to nominate Rehnquist for the chief justiceship and leaned toward replacing Rehnquist with Scalia, in part because he was nearly a decade younger than Bork, though there was some concern about the quickness of his temper. Scalia was scheduled to meet with the president on June 16. Riffing on the flap between Meese and Brennan, Scalia in his June speech had cataloged the weaknesses of the doctrine of original intent, including by pointing out that the early Supreme Court could not possibly have followed it, because James Madison's notes on the Constitutional Convention, generally cited by originalists as definitive, were not available until 1840. What people who talked about original intent must mean, then, Scalia argued—essentially offering Meese a way out of the box he'd locked himself in—was not the original intent of the Framers but of the Constitution: It is not that the Constitution must mean this because Alexander Hamilton thought it meant this, and he wrote it'; but rather that the Constitution must mean this because Alexander Hamilton, who for Pete's sake must have understood the thing, thought it meant this.' The doctrine of original intent, Scalia concluded, just needed a better name; he proposed the doctrine of original meaning. (Originalism, perhaps surprisingly, is quite changeable, and originalists have for decades come up with new varieties, so many niceties.) Illustration by Tyler Comrie. Source: allanswart \/ iStock \/ Getty When Biden seemed baffled, Scalia said he'd be happy to explain the distinction but it wouldn't be worth it, because, he admitted, it's not a big difference. As for that June speech, in which Scalia had professed his allegiance to originalism, Biden told Scalia wearily, I just hope you don't mean it. But he very much did. Originalism in the 1970s and '80s was an outsider's game. Originalists accused the Supreme Court of amending the law by creating new rights, such as the right to an abortion, and insisted both that Article V amendment was the only legitimate method of constitutional change and that originalism was the only legitimate method of constitutional interpretation. Practically, though, originalism took hold from the failure of conservatives to change the Constitution by democratic means—by means of amendment. Since the days of the New Deal, social and especially fiscal conservatives had now and again called for constitutional amendments and even for a constitutional convention. Among their more notable efforts was a campaign starting in 1939 to call a convention to repeal the Sixteenth Amendment, which provides for a federal income tax. For the entirety of the Warren and Burger Courts, there had also been calls for a constitutional convention: in the 1950s, to overturn Brown v. Board of Education, which found racial segregation in public schools to be unconstitutional, and in the 1960s, to repeal the Court's one man, one vote decisions. A balanced budget amendment, first seriously proposed in the '50s, gained support during the economic malaise and rising federal debt of Jimmy Carter's presidency. By March 1979, 28 states had called for a convention to adopt a balanced budget amendment. Richard Rovere, the celebrated Washington correspondent for The New Yorker, believed that the call for a constitutional convention was a bluff and that Congress would pass a stand alone balanced budget amendment in order to avoid the terrifying prospect of a convention—which, he warned, might throw out much or all of the Bill of Rights and could lead possibly even to civil war. Sixty five percent of Americans favored a constitutional convention. Scalia, asked at a forum that May whether the prospect was really all that dangerous, joked that it was always possible a constitutional convention might pass a bill of attainder to hang Richard Rovere, but said he'd support a convention on abortion. One person who was decidedly unwilling to run that risk was the conservative insurgency's most prominent political strategist, Phyllis Schlafly. A convention called for the purpose of a balanced budget amendment might get out of hand and turn its mind to other business—becoming a so called runaway convention—and very likely undo all her work to defeat the Equal Rights Amendment. She went to war, and she won. Aside from defeating the ERA and making the Republican Party pro life, Schlafly considered defeating a convention in the 1980s her signal achievement. Herein lie the origins of originalism's rise to power: in the failures of the right to life amendment and the balanced budget amendment. It was at this very moment that the Federalist Society was founded. The subsequent history of originalism has everything to do with abortion, and everything else to do with guns. One in three Americans owns a gun; one in four American women will have an abortion. In the 1970s, as partisanship strengthened and polarization worsened, guns and abortion became the defining constitutional issues in the life and death, winner take all fury of modern American politics. On the left, abortion came to mean freedom and guns murder; on the right, guns came to mean freedom and abortion murder. That none of these equivalencies can withstand scrutiny has not seemed to matter. In 1975, the District of Columbia introduced a law that all but banned the possession or sale of any handgun. That year, there were two assassination attempts on President Gerald Ford. The National Council to Control Handguns proposed a national ban. In 1976, the California legislature debated a similar bill; opponents proposed a state constitutional amendment guaranteeing a right to keep and bear handguns, rifles, and shotguns. There was no reason to believe that any of these gun control measures violated the Second Amendment, which the Court had hardly ever paid attention to and in any case had long read as concerning only the keeping and bearing of arms for military purposes—not as a right pertaining to citizens as individuals—and as limiting only the federal government, not the states. The National Rifle Association, whose motto since 1957 had been Firearms safety education, marksmanship training, shooting for recreation, had endorsed the 1968 Gun Control Act. But in the mid 1970s, the NRA began organizing in opposition to handgun control laws. Ronald Reagan, who had just left the California governor's office, joined this campaign, too. In an article published in Guns & Ammo in 1975, Reagan advocated for the altogether novel and unsupported individual rights interpretation of the Second Amendment, maintaining that it appears to leave little, if any, leeway for the gun control advocate. In 1977, the NRA abandoned a planned move to Colorado to remain in Washington, where it became essentially a lobbying organization, with a new motto displayed at the entrance of its building: The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. In 1981, Strom Thurmond appointed Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on the Constitution. Hatch had already proposed a right to life amendment, and an amendment outlawing affirmative action. Reagan would later consider naming him to the Supreme Court. Amending the Constitution having failed, Hatch was now interested not in a new amendment but in an old one. Upon assuming the chairmanship, he called immediately for a report on the original meaning of the Second Amendment. While Hatch's subcommittee was at work, Reagan was shot; his press secretary, James Brady, was also shot. Reagan continued his opposition to gun control legislation; Brady became an advocate for it. In February 1982, Hatch's subcommittee published a report called The Right to Keep and Bear Arms. The subcommittee maintained that it had found clear—and long lost—proof that the second amendment to our Constitution was intended as an individual right of the American citizen to keep and carry arms in a peaceful manner, for protection of himself, his family, and his freedoms. That November, after the NRA waged a well funded campaign against California's handgun control bill, voters resoundingly defeated it in a statewide referendum. As the Reagan administration prepared for the Constitution's bicentennial, a private committee was set up to consider possible constitutional reforms. Its members included present and former elected officials, scholars, and business and labor leaders, and its focus was largely on addressing the growing problems of congressional gridlock and budgetary brinkmanship. In a compilation of working papers published in 1985, it urged Americans not to treat the Constitution as immutable, like the Ark of the Covenant, but to be open to changes, such as amendments. It recommended six, including longer congressional terms and bonus seats in the House and the Senate for the party that wins the presidency. None of these ideas made any headway. It wasn't voters who were opposed to amendments. The hurdle was Congress—and, more and more, conservatives. In 1984, James McClellan, who had left his position as a staff member on the Senate Judiciary Committee to become the president of a newly formed Center for Judicial Studies, urged conservatives to kick the habit of Article V. There is something fundamentally wrong with our system if we are driven to amend the Constitution so as to restore its original meaning, McClellan wrote. We should resist efforts to add amendments to our fundamental law to correct misinterpretations rendered by the Supreme Court. Better to effect constitutional change under the guise of restoring the Constitution's original meaning. But that would require taking over the Court. When Meese became attorney general in 1985, he announced that originalism would govern judicial selection. John Paul Stevens would later recall that between 1969, when Burger became chief justice, and 1986, when Scalia joined, no judge or justice expressed any doubt about the limited coverage of the [second] amendment. But in 1986, Congress passed the Firearms Owners' Protection Act, which repealed parts of the 1968 Gun Control Act by invoking the rights of citizens to keep and bear arms under the second amendment. This was by no means an article of faith among conservatives. To the contrary. Bork, for instance, did not endorse this theory. I'm not an expert on the Second Amendment, he said in 1989, but its intent was to guarantee the right of states to form militia, not for individuals to bear arms. From retirement in 1991, Warren Burger, appearing on PBS and holding a pocket Constitution in his hands, said that if he were writing the Bill of Rights, he wouldn't include the Second Amendment, adding that the NRA's individual rights interpretation was one of the greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word fraud, on the American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime. The test of originalism would be whether this interpretation—an amendment by fiat—would be accepted by the Supreme Court. As the Constitution's bicentennial year began, Meese's Office of Legal Policy issued a 200 page sourcebook on original meaning jurisprudence, containing excerpts from the work of Bork, Scalia, and Meese himself, with Brennan as a counterpoint. It alleged that until the 1960s, original meaning jurisprudence had been the dominant form of constitutional interpretation during most of our nation's history. Meanwhile, plans were drawn up for grocery store cashiers to give away free copies of the Constitution; the government was to print enough for every American household. A facsimile of the Constitution went on the road, along with an original of the Magna Carta, in a temperature controlled, 40 foot trailer that traveled to more than 100 cities. ABC ran a series of Bicentennial Constitutional Minutes during Saturday morning cartoons, featuring characters from Looney Tunes. Professor Bugs Bunny, dressed in cap and gown at the front of a lecture hall, sings, Our Constitution's really splendid, but sometimes we do amend it. Daffy Duck, dressed as a vaudevillian in waistcoat and spats, soft shoes across the stage, while Bugs belts out, It was intended! To be amended! And it was intended to be amended. But it was no longer amendable. Instead of producing constitutional amendments, liberals achieved landmark legislative gains and rights protecting Court decisions whose importance was matched only by their reversibility. Conservatives of course were abandoning amendment too, instead seeking constitutional change by judicial appointments and judicial interpretation. Reagan transformed the judiciary; not since FDR had a single president replaced so high a percentage of the federal bench. He nominated Bork to the Supreme Court in July 1987, but the prospects for confirmation were mixed at best: The president was a visibly aging lame duck and reeling, too, from the Iran Contra scandal; Republicans had lost the Senate in the 1986 midterms, with the result that Biden, not Thurmond, was now chair of a Democratic run Senate Judiciary Committee. Scalia had replaced Rehnquist, which meant that his appointment didn't change the balance on the Court. But Bork would be replacing Lewis Powell, often a swing vote. On the day Reagan announced the nomination, Ted Kennedy described Robert Bork's America as a land in which women would be forced into back alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, and schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution. Writers and artists would be censured at the whim of government, and the doors of the federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens for whom the judiciary is, and is often, the only protector of the individual rights that are the heart of our democracy. Bork afterward insisted that there was not a line in that speech that was accurate, but it had raised the stakes for the hearings. Warren Burger wanted Congress to declare Constitution Day, September 17, 1987 (which happened to fall on his own 80th birthday), a onetime national holiday. But, in a speech in Hawaii, Justice Thurgood Marshall declared his refusal to participate in any such celebration. I do not believe that the meaning of the Constitution was forever fixed' at the Philadelphia Convention, Marshall said. Nor do I find the wisdom, foresight, and sense of justice exhibited by the Framers particularly profound. When Constitution Day came, Reagan delivered a bicentennial address at Independence Hall, in Philadelphia, calling the Constitution a covenant with the supreme being, and CBS televised Philadelphia's Constitution Day parade. But on C SPAN that day, you could watch a very different discussion of the Constitution: Robert Bork explaining his understanding of the nation's founding document. Biden's staff had advised him not to center his attack on abortion but instead to call attention to Bork's judicial philosophy, while Bork's opponents waged a remorseless and relentless campaign against his confirmation. In an unprecedented attack on a Supreme Court nominee, People for the American Way aired a television ad narrated by Gregory Peck. If Robert Bork wins a seat on the Supreme Court, it will be for life, Peck warned. His life and yours. A Block Bork Coalition argued that Bork would turn back the clock on civil rights, women's rights, and workers' rights. Making the case that Bork would not hesitate to overturn Roe, no matter what he told the committee, Kennedy played an audio recording from 1985 in which Bork had said, I don't think that in the field of constitutional law, precedent is all that important. In a cover story published on September 21, four days after the Constitution Day parade, Time magazine hinted that if Bork were confirmed, Roe might go. Roe did not go, at least not then. Bork went instead, defeated 4258. Having endured a brutal series of attacks, many of them unwarranted, he sought vindication in a tell all book recounting his experience of the confirmation process—he noted, for instance, how news stories on CBS ran eight to one against him. Intended to tamp down the politicization of Supreme Court appointments, Bork's book only inflamed it. If Bork's nomination had been a referendum on originalism, originalism had lost. But originalism also won, because it had been brought so entirely into the public eye. Biden gave originalism 115 days of free television at the height of the nation's celebration of the Constitution's bicentennial. Scalia, meanwhile, bided his time. In 1989, abortion again came before the Court. Webster v. Reproductive Health Services involved an abortion restricting Missouri law. Rehnquist wrote a draft opinion that both upheld the law and, almost as an afterthought, essentially overturned Roe by arguing that the key elements of Roe are not found in the text of the Constitution or in any place else one would expect to find a constitutional principle. Stevens, who had been wavering, declined to join the majority, circulating a memo in which he said that he'd rather not overturn Roe, but if it had to be done, he'd rather give it a decent burial instead of tossing it out the window of a fast moving caboose. O'Connor agreed, which everyone assumed would elicit a strong reaction from Scalia. The expected Ninogram' will arrive this morning, Justice Harry Blackmun's clerk wrote, anticipating Scalia's fury that the majority opinion would fall short of overturning Roe. Scalia was indeed furious, scolding the Court in his concurrence: We can now look forward to at least another Term with carts full of mail from the public, and streets full of demonstrators urging us—their unelected and life tenured judges who have been awarded those extraordinary, undemocratic characteristics precisely in order that we might follow the law despite the popular will—to follow the popular will. The Court again upheld Roe in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, in 1992. Scalia said, The only reason you need a Constitution is because some things you don't want the majority to be able to change. Those things are fundamental rights, and Scalia did not believe that a woman's right to decide whether to end a pregnancy, even if her life was in danger, was one of them. Unlike an individual right to bear arms. Because neither side in the abortion debate had succeeded in amending the Constitution, the right to an abortion asserted from Roe to Casey remained vulnerable. By the end of the 1980s, the parties had sorted themselves over this issue. Few were the commentators who, like the feminist legal scholar Joan C. Williams, acknowledged that views on abortion were nuanced, complicated, deeply felt, and likely irreconcilable. I, for example, am convinced, absolutely convinced without hesitation, that the Constitution protects a woman's right to choose abortion as a basic, undeniable political right, a right without which many other political rights are worthless, Williams wrote. And yet I can see how the conclusion that seems so obvious to me can seem foreign, even repulsive to others—a celibate priest, say, or a mother of five—and I must acknowledge that consensus on this issue is not in the cards. The abandonment of amendment has meant that constitutional history since the 1970s has turned on presidential nominations to the Supreme Court, placing pressure on that institution that it has proved nearly unable to bear. Presidential elections no longer involved campaigns to amend the Constitution. They involved campaigns to appoint justices. Nomination hearings have become spectacles. Trust in the Court has plummeted. And it's no longer clear that the president of the United States will honor its decisions. In 1991, when George H. W. Bush nominated D.C. Court of Appeals Judge Clarence Thomas to replace Thurgood Marshall in what some called the Black seat on the Court, opponents of the nominee again braced for battle. This time the hearings took a nasty turn when Anita Hill, a Black law professor and former colleague of Thomas's, testified before an all male, all white Senate Judiciary Committee that Thomas had sexually harassed her. Other women had made similar allegations, but only Hill had been called to appear before the committee, where Biden, as chair, altogether failed to restrain Republican Senators Orrin Hatch, Arlen Specter, and Alan Simpson from essentially placing Hill on trial. Thomas, citing his own right to privacy, refused to answer questions about what goes on in the most intimate parts of my private life or the sanctity of my bedroom. Questions about Thomas's qualifications to serve as a justice were set aside, overwhelmed by the attention given to the allegations of sexual harassment. Feminists had defeated Bork by claiming that he would turn back the clock on women's rights and undo Roe. By the time Bush nominated Thomas, sexual harassment was the unforgivable sin of the day. The Thomas hearings also set a precedent, prefiguring the airing of sexual assault charges levied at Donald Trump's nominee Brett Kavanaugh in 2018, and the reckless, remorseless, and wildly partisan news coverage in which liberal news organizations appeared less interested in reporting on the nomination than in defeating it, while conservative organizations sought only to secure the confirmation. The Senate confirmed Thomas, 52 to 48. In 1993, Bill Clinton desperately needed to appoint a woman to the high court. Ruth Bader Ginsburg was rightly celebrated as the Thurgood Marshall of women's rights. She'd first appeared before the Supreme Court in 1973, and as the head of the women's rights program at the ACLU, she had methodically chipped away at discrimination on the basis of sex, each case, as she once put it, another small, guarded step. Yet she refused to take on cases that would have required her to defend Roe, which she believed had been badly decided (among other things, she wished the case had rested on an argument for equality, not privacy). Jimmy Carter had named her to the D.C. Circuit in 1980, where she served alongside Scalia and Bork. Roe v. Wade sparked public opposition and academic criticism, in part, I believe, because the Court ventured too far in the change it ordered and presented an incomplete justification for its action, she said in 1984. In 1993, at NYU, she had cited Roe as an example of a bad judicial decision. When Clinton nominated her to the Court, leading women's groups refused to endorse her. Fourteen members of the faculty of NYU Law School signed a letter stating that they were distressed that her remarks at NYU have been misconstrued as anti choice and anti women. The Senate confirmed her 963. The fact that she had grave doubts about Roe would be forgotten and, by the left, forgiven. There were rumors, in the spring of 2000, that if Al Gore were to win the presidency, Scalia would resign, at age 64. A Gore presidency would eliminate his chance of becoming Chief Justice and ensure that his jurisprudence will never be anything more than a footnote, one reporter wrote at the time. During the campaign, Gore pledged that, if elected, he would look for justices of the Supreme Court who understand that our Constitution is a living and breathing document, that it was intended by our Founders to be interpreted in the light of the constantly evolving experience of the American people. After Bush v. Gore, which resolved the disputed 2000 election results in Florida in favor of Bush, giving him the presidency, Scalia, who had generally failed to build a conservative coalition on the Court, became more isolated. In Lawrence v. Texas (2003), the Court found laws banning homosexual conduct to be unconstitutional. Scalia, dissenting from the bench, said that while he did not endorse the Texas law at issue—he once said he wished all judges were given a stamp that said Stupid but Constitutional—the Court had no right to overturn it and was, instead, taking sides in a culture war. (Where did the Court find the right to homosexual behavior in the Constitution? he would later ask. On the basis of, I don't know, the sexual preference clause of the Bill of Rights?) Amendments defining marriage as between one man and one woman were first introduced in Congress in 2002. Two years later, the GOP platform endorsed such an amendment for the first time. But public opinion increasingly favored allowing same sex marriage. Fifty percent of Americans favored a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage in 2003; that fell to 37 percent in 2008. In 2015, in Obergefell v. Hodges, the Court held that same sex marriage is protected under the Fourteenth Amendment. If Scalia had waved aside Biden's question, in 1986, about the difference between original intent and original meaning, he eventually settled the matter in his own mind. The theory of originalism treats a constitution like a statute, and gives it the meaning that its words were understood to bear at the time they were promulgated, he explained. He brought his case to the public in a series of interviews and speeches that pundits came to call the Dead Constitution Tour. When I find it—the original meaning of the Constitution—I am handcuffed, he'd say, pressing his hands together, as if bound. The Constitution is not a living organism, for Pete's sake, he'd say, and then recite the familiar refrain: It's dead, dead! The case Scalia had been waiting for finally came before the Court in 2007, in District of Columbia v. Heller, a challenge to D.C.'s handgun ban. The work of discovering the original meaning of the Constitution, Scalia had once said, was a task sometimes better suited to the historian than the lawyer. But in case after case, he set aside briefs submitted by distinguished historians in favor of his own reading of a carefully selected set of historical documents. No application of this method was more consequential than his reinterpretation of the Second Amendment in Heller, an opinion that Scalia considered to be, as he told NPR's Nina Totenberg, the most complete originalist opinion that I've ever written. Heller is an excellent illustration of the distance between originalism and historical scholarship. Historians are often asked what the Founders would think about various aspects of contemporary life, read an amicus brief submitted by 15 eminent university professors of early American history. Such questions can be tricky to answer. But as historians of the Revolutionary era we are confident at least of this: that the authors of the Second Amendment would be flabbergasted to learn that in endorsing the republican principle of a well regulated militia, they were also precluding restrictions on such potentially dangerous property as firearms, which governments had always regulated when there was real danger of public injury from individuals.' In June 2008, in a 54 opinion, Scalia held most of the provisions of the handgun law unconstitutional. The Court had before it all the materials needed to determine the meaning of the Second Amendment at the time it was written, he explained. With these in hand, what method would be easier or more reliable than the originalist approach taken by the Court? He then set aside the brief written by distinguished scholars of American history who disagreed with his interpretation of the Second Amendment. Relying on his own reading of history, Scalia insisted that the Second Amendment protects the right of citizens to bear arms not only to defend the state in a militia but also to defend themselves as individuals. The day after the Court issued its opinion, The Wall Street Journal ran an op ed by Randy Barnett, a Georgetown law professor and the author of Restoring the Lost Constitution, under the headline News Flash: The Constitution Means What It Says. Barnett argued that in the future, we should be vetting Supreme Court nominees to see if they understand how Justice Scalia reasoned in Heller and if they are committed to doing the same. This proved prophetic. I used to be able to say with a good deal of truth that one could fire a cannon loaded with grapeshot in the faculty lounge of any law school in the country and not strike an originalist, Scalia, delighted with his triumph in Heller, said at a Federalist Society meeting. That's no longer true. But the criticism of Heller had been pointed, too, beginning with sharply worded dissents written by Justices Stevens and Stephen Breyer. In McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010), Stevens described Scalia's account of the Second Amendment as part of a rudderless, panoramic tour of American legal history that was not only bad history, but also bad constitutional law. Stevens would later propose amending the Second Amendment to avoid Scalia's misinterpretation. Criticism of Heller had also come from conservative quarters. J. Harvie Wilkinson III, a retired conservative Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals judge, argued that Scalia had done exactly what he accused liberals of doing: He had found in the Constitution a new right, a right of self defense, a right that the Court had never acknowledged in the more than two hundred years since the amendment's enactment. By now, the Second Amendment, like Roe, had come to feature in judicial confirmation hearings. Elena Kagan, nominated to the Court by Barack Obama in 2010, was asked so many questions about whether she had ever hunted or even held a gun (she hadn't) that, in a private session with a member of the Senate, she promised that, if confirmed, she would go hunting with Scalia. (And when she was confirmed, she did.) Originalism appeared to gain strength, even as it lost all historical coherence in Thomas's bewildering opinion in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen in 2022, a decision announced in the same term that, with Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the Court overturned Roe. In Bruen, which came six years after Scalia's death, Thomas applied a text, history, and tradition test, requiring lawyers to demonstrate the existence of an 18th century (or in some cases 19th century) historical analogue to any law that in any way restricted or regulated the ownership of firearms. If no analogue could be found, the law violated the Second Amendment. (Tradition is a living thing, Justice John Marshall Harlan II once wrote; the Roberts Court disagreed.) American history is full of gun laws at the municipal, county, and state level—rules and restrictions of nearly every kind and variety—which meant that lawyers and organizations all over the country were left to dedicate countless hours to arcane historical research to meet the requirements of Bruen. An entirely new field of the history of firearms law emerged, documenting that if anything could fairly be said of American text, history, and tradition, it was that Americans had always been interested both in owning guns and in imposing rules on their manufacture, sale, use, and ownership. Two years after Bruen, in United States v. Rahimi, the Court would attempt to walk back Bruen by clarifying that its intent in its recent Second Amendment cases was not to suggest a law trapped in amber. (Thomas dissented.) But originalism, like the text, history, and tradition test, had become so confused that seven justices found it necessary to offer separate opinions in Rahimi, each attempting to explain what originalism is or isn't, or ever was or wasn't. Without Scalia, originalism—its conceptual integrity as constitutional theory—disintegrated. Its political power, however, remains intact. Antonin Scalia considered Heller to be his most important legacy. But he also wanted to leave behind an originalist instruction manual. That book, Reading Law, appeared in 2012, jointly authored with the legal scholar and lexicographer Bryan Garner. In a chapter called Thirteen Falsities Exposed, Scalia and Garner discuss Heller under the heading The false notion that lawyers and judges, not being historians, are unqualified to do the historical research that originalism requires. Historical research is not a difficult endeavor, they alleged. Nor are historical sources difficult to discover or to read. Nor is such a reading likely to be inconclusive. The historical record is, instead, legible, unitary, and dispositive. Learning how to read law requires three years of law school and the study of many books, like the more than 500 page textbook Reading Law, but anyone can write history and anyone who says otherwise has exaggerated the nature of the work. This, unsurprisingly, did not quiet Scalia's detractors. Heller is the most criticized of all of Scalia's opinions. The Seventh Circuit judge (and Reagan nominee) Richard Posner wrote in a review: Reading Law is Scalia's response to the criticism. It is unconvincing. Scalia and Garner had suggested that one tool that made reading history so simple was the availability of so many amicus briefs written by actual historians. But as Posner observed, The book's defense of the Heller decision fails to mention that most professional historians reject the historical analysis in Scalia's opinion. Scalia must have known that the historical record is scarcely ever unambiguous. In Heller, Justice Stevens had stacked his historical evidence up against Scalia's. What made Scalia's history into law was that he got five votes, and Stevens got only four. That didn't make Scalia's history right. Yet Scalia may have wielded his greatest influence not on the Court but outside it. At a certain point, he seems to have become more interested in speaking to his admirers off the Court than in winning votes on it. He had an insatiable appetite for intellectual battle, but as political rhetoric heated up after the election of Barack Obama, in 2008, Scalia found himself the subject of ceaseless personal attack. Understandably, he grew weary and alienated. Like many Americans, he found the polarization of the press troubling and the insurrectionary style of American politics unbearable. The crazier the far right press of Fox News got, the crazier became MSNBC, CNN, and even the nation's newspapers of record. At the beginning of Obama's second term, Scalia told a reporter that he didn't read The New York Times and had given up on reading The Washington Post, saying that it went too far for me. I couldn't handle it anymore. By then, he said, he was getting most of his news from talk radio. Heller, he began to fear, had been originalism's high point. But after that case, originalism soared on the Supreme Court, as Trump added three originalist justices to the bench: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. In 2022, this originalism powered Court overturned Roe. Progressives, who expect originalism to prevail on the Court for decades to come, have attempted to devise something called progressive originalism, seemingly favored by the Biden appointed justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. As one law professor explained in 2022, If conservative judges are making selective use of history to make originalist arguments for conservative results, then the only way to show this is to make better originalist arguments to the contrary. Would judging law be reduced to the act of choosing among competing accounts of the past written by different groups of historians, based on some as yet undefined method of determining which account is the correct one? It hasn't worked out that way. In a series of crucial cases, the Trump era Court cited history if the history supported a preferred outcome; if history did not support that outcome, the Court simply ignored the past. As the liberal justice Sonia Sotomayor observed in a scorching dissent in the presidential immunity case Trump v. United States, It seems history matters to this Court only when it is convenient. The Constitution is dead! Scalia liked to say. To many Americans in the early decades of the 21st century, it has begun to seem that way, although half of the country blames Republicans and the other half blames Democrats. In 2021, one in three Americans said they might consider either abolishing the Supreme Court or limiting its power. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a former Harvard law professor, co sponsored a new Judiciary Act to restructure the Court. Warren charged the conservative six justice supermajority with pursuing a deeply unpopular and partisan agenda at odds with the Constitution and the settled rights of our citizens. In 2022, Trump, citing Massive Fraud in the 2020 election and seeking reelection, called for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution. Democrats called for two justices, Thomas and Alito, to recuse themselves in cases relating to the 2020 election and the January 6 insurrection, arguing that their wives had been publicly associated with the Stop the Steal effort; when they refused, Democrats in Congress called for their impeachment. After Dobbs and Bruen, public estimation of the legitimacy of the Court fell to record lows, although opinion divided along strictly partisan lines. This year, after Trump returned to the White House, he was asked whether he has a duty to uphold the Constitution. He said he didn't know. Scalia did not live to witness this crisis in constitutionalism. In an exceptionally candid interview near the end of his life, he speculated that he might be despised for his legacy, adding, And I don't care. Long before, playing Macbeth onstage back in high school, he'd uttered some of Shakespeare's most aching lines: Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more. Did he ever wonder if that might be true of the Constitution, if he had been wrong, and if it were, all along, a living thing, though now stunted, thwarted, ailing? In 2016, during a quail hunting trip in Texas, he died in his sleep, at age 79. The Constitution limps along, a walking shadow.

    "content":"Shortly after the end of the Iran Iraq War, the United States Institute of Peace held an event in Washington, D.C., to discuss the Middle East's delicate prospects. Panelists suggested ever more intricate ways to give regional peace a chance, until the neoconservative Michael Ledeen spoke out heretically. You have heard the case for peace, he said. I rise to speak on behalf of war. He said that the conflict, which lasted from 1980 to 1988 and killed perhaps a million people, had been a good war. And he said that any peace between the United States and a government as malevolent as Iran's would be a sham, and a prelude to more war. Peace is what happens when one side imposes conditions on another, Ledeen told me in 2013. He said it is not enough for both sides to stop fighting. One of them must lose. Ledeen died in May, well into his fifth decade of arguing against peace, or at least a sham peace, with Iran. War had its chance just weeks later. On June 13, Israel assassinated high ranking Iranian officials and neutralized Iranian air defenses. During the next 12 days, Israel and Iran traded missile strikes. About 1,000 Iranians and dozens of Israelis died. Iran's Axis of Resistance, its federation of militias and other allies, did not show up to fight. On June 22, the U.S. bombed three Iranian nuclear sites and declared the conflict over. The Trump administration said that the country's nuclear program had been obliterated, but no public evidence has confirmed that claim. Ledeen, if he were alive, would no doubt note that at the end of the war, Iran did not accept any cease fire conditions. In fact, Iran's official position is that it never accepted a cease fire at all. Now that talk of what happens after war is back, I rise to make the case for dj vu. The region risks reverting to its default setting, which is peace that has characteristics of war, with Iran planning to attack its enemies but not actively doing so, and vice versa. This is a regime on its last legs, but it could last like that for another 20 years, Michael Doran, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, told me. They took a blow, but I see no signs that it's ready to fall. In the past, Iran has recovered from its tribulations by revising its strategy and finding novel ways to subvert the United States, Israel, and their interests. It should be expected to recover once more. Even before the Axis of Resistance turned out to be an Axis of No Shows, the Islamic Republic had suffered humiliating defeats: bombings and assassinations inside Iran itself; the decimation of Hezbollah, its most sophisticated proxy; the slow and bloody dismantling of another proxy, Hamas; the collapse of its main state ally, Bashar al Assad's regime in Syria. In December, Iran's 86 year old supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, said that his country's predicament reminded him of the absolute nadir of the Islamic Republic, which was the Iran Iraq War. He noted for his audience members that few of them were alive—but he was—when Iraqi warplanes bombed Tehran. I was giving a speech at a factory near Tehran's airport, Khamenei reminisced, in an especially portentous installment of Imam Story Hour. I saw an Iraqi plane descending, dropping its bombs on the airport and then flying away. We have witnessed these things. He said the belief that these difficult moments were setbacks was mistaken. He spoke optimistically of Iran's allies. The Resistance Front is not a piece of hardware that can be broken, dismantled, or destroyed, he said. It doesn't weaken under pressure; it also becomes stronger. Some of this was bluster. Khamenei could hardly have delivered a speech acknowledging that the double act of Great and Little Satan had won. But his rendition of the history of the Axis of Resistance—from its birth out of necessity, to its success, to its present adversities—is largely accurate. In the past year, I visited several countries where Iran has made inventive use of its limited resources. The trip was a survey of destruction and dismay. The Axis, which bought Iran 20 years of survival and peace, wrecked the places where it operated. This wreckage was intentional. Iran prefers weak allies over strong ones, and corrupt and corruptible governments over ones that respond to their citizens' needs. The purpose of Iran is Shiite theocracy, for its own sake and as a counterweight to democratic, secular, and Sunni governments allied with the United States in the region. Khamenei has made the argument to his own people that the Islamic Republic is an anti fragile empire. It gets closer to its purpose and stronger when attacked and should therefore be patient and steadfast, focusing on surviving to learn from its failures. To Iran's enemies, he has inadvertently made the opposite argument: that defeating Iran means vigorously prosecuting the war now, giving no chance for Iran to survive, and finally imposing a peace that will last. The Axis of Resistance is a simple concept: a network of armed friends of Iran, spread across the region and on call to fight against Iran's enemies. As of mid 2024, this network was a cordon around the country itself, a line of what Iran called forward defense that kept its enemies busy hundreds of miles away from Iran's own border. Its main members were Hezbollah in Lebanon, Shiite militias in Iraq, the Houthi de facto government in Yemen, the Alawite government of Syria, and Hamas in Gaza. Iran, by far the world's largest Shiite majority country, encouraged these groups—mostly Shiite minorities—by scouting them, nurturing the most promising, and building trust and fellow feeling. Iran's leaders and allies spoke of a unity of the arenas. Any attack against one could draw retribution by another, somewhere far away. For years, members of the Axis armed themselves and conducted regular harassment operations—for example, rocket attacks against Israel and American bases in Iraq. Before Israel began a counterattack against Hezbollah in September 2024, this strategy was reckoned brilliant by Iran's supporters and adversaries alike. A U.S. diplomat had told me the month before that the Iranian strategy works to this day. He said time was on Iran's side. I suspect we'll be out of the region before they're out of business. One Lebanese Shiite politician told me that the United States and Israel should stop being such sore losers. Don't blame Iran, he said. His voice was pitying and patient, like a peewee soccer coach imparting a lesson of sportsmanship. If we play, you lose the ball, and I shoot, I score, it's your mistake, he said. Move on. Within a matter of months, the Axis line of defense had been broken. Only the Houthis remain more or less intact, and indeed resilient against Israeli and American retaliation. Although the Axis is in shambles now, it was no failure. It dictated the terms of Middle East geopolitics for 20 years and allowed a poor, isolated nation, run by partisans of a small religious sect, to keep stronger and richer countries scrambling, spending billions of dollars just to maintain a status quo in which those countries were periodically peppered with rockets and drone attacks. The strategy was thrust upon the Islamic Republic after others failed. Directly after its 1979 revolution, Iran busied itself with internal enemies. It labored mightily to suppress and, when convenient, murder those reluctant to support the revolution's leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. In 1980, when Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, seized oil fields on the Iranian border, under the assumption that Iran was too distracted to object, Iran saw an opportunity to pivot to fighting external enemies. Far from letting Iraq take its land, Iran fought back and recovered its territory within two years. Saddam sued for peace, but Iran rejected him and opted to turn the war into a death match. It lasted for the next six years. The United States and other Western powers were delighted to watch both countries suffer. Sunni monarchies propped up Iraq when it looked ready to collapse. The war prompted the most reptilian of Henry Kissinger's quips: It's a pity, he reportedly said, they can't both lose. But they did both lose, and badly. One would have to look back to Passchendaele, the Somme, or Stalingrad to find a similarly pointless churn of death at this scale. Iraq used chemical weapons and other outr methods of killing, such as putting electrified cables into bogs and zapping Iranian infantrymen as they waded through. (We are frying them like eggplants, an Iraqi officer told the Los Angeles Times in 1984.) Iran deployed human wave attacks and recruited child soldiers as human minesweepers. In his book about the war, the scholar Efraim Karsh quotes an Iraqi officer who faced an Iranian human wave: They chant Allahu Akbar and they keep coming, and we keep shooting, sweeping our 50 millimetre machine guns around like sickles. My men are eighteen, nineteen, just a few years older than these kids. I've seen them crying, and at times the officers have had to kick them back to their guns. Once we had Iranian kids on bikes cycling towards us, and my men all started laughing, and then these kids started lobbing their hand grenades and we stopped laughing and started shooting. The war ended in 1988 without strategic gain for either side. Both were exhausted. Khomeini died in 1989. A 49 year old minor cleric named Ali Khamenei succeeded him as leader of an Islamic Republic that was a mutilated shadow of its revolutionary self. Virtually all of Iran's recent military leaders, including the architect of the Axis of Resistance, General Qassem Soleimani, fought in the Iran Iraq War and learned its main lesson: not to do that again. Big wars are catastrophic. After this miserable experience, Iran spent the 1990s and early 2000s like a sailor in port: wandering, getting in trouble, never quite mustering long term planning or vision. Because it had an international reputation as mad, bad, and dangerous, it had little choice but to innovate. The Iranians took a good, hard look at themselves, a former U.S. intelligence official told me. They said: We've got no technology. We have no friends. We don't have money. They said, We need an unconventional approach. That approach originated in Lebanon. In 1982, several years into the Lebanese civil war, Israel invaded Lebanon to dismantle the Palestine Liberation Organization, then headquartered in Beirut. Iran trained and supported Hezbollah to counter Israel, the United States, and the Sunni and Christian Lebanese militias. No party in the war was blameless, but Hezbollah distinguished itself by outright rejecting norms of war and diplomacy. It took hostages and tortured them. It attacked embassies and civilians, inside and outside the country. It pioneered the use of suicide bombs. In 1983, a Hezbollah operative blew up 241 American soldiers and Marines in their barracks next to Beirut International Airport. The bomber is said to have been grinning as he sped past the checkpoint and crashed into the building. Hezbollah was built to fight. In 1989, when all other Lebanese groups agreed to give up arms and become political entities, Hezbollah remained armed so that it could continue fighting Israel. Hezbollah persisted until Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000—a moment of celebration and vindication for Hezbollah, and for Iran, a sign that the Hezbollah model held promise elsewhere. Hezbollah took advantage of its win to dig tunnels and stockpile missiles for the sole purpose of attacking Israel. Iran now had a seasoned fighting force, assembled at minimal cost out of Arab Shiite volunteers, with nary an Iranian among them to be shot or electrocuted on the battlefield. When Hezbollah killed Americans and Israelis, it received little in the way of punishment or retribution. It drove out enemy invaders, and it held its own against Israel in a monthlong war in 2006. Later, when Syria looked ready to fall to Sunni jihadists, Hezbollah answered the call and crossed the border to terrorize the population and keep the Assad regime in power.

The Hezbollah model followed a three step recipe: create a proxy; arm it to fight by any means necessary; wait for it to outlast the enemy. An alternative to creating a proxy is finding one. Because the Middle East is rife with hostility toward America as well as domestic governments, Iran found these friends easily. An Axis member could flourish as long as there was a vacuum of responsibility, where no competent government was present to discipline it. Acute chaos helped, allowing Iran to provide guns and training. Most but not all of the proxies were Shiite. Hamas, for example, is Sunni, and the Houthis of Yemen and Alawites of Syria practice forms of Shiism distinct from Iran's. The phrase Axis of Resistance was coined by a Libyan journalist in 2002, as an alternative to the Axis of Evil tag applied by President George W. Bush to Iran, Iraq, and North Korea that same year. Soon, Iranians were using it themselves. David Frum: The enduring lessons of the Axis of Evil' speech Just as Iran needed Israel's occupation of Lebanon to cultivate Hezbollah, it needed the U.S. occupation of Iraq to fertilize and grow Axis partners there. Iran did not initially welcome the 2003 invasion. Its first response was to put its entire nuclear program on ice, almost certainly out of fear that it would be invaded next. The early months of the U.S. occupation of Iraq went well compared with the years that followed, in part because the senior Shiite cleric in Iraq, Ayatollah Ali al Sistani, was then—and continues to be, at the age of 95—a sort of anti Khomeini, at least in his attitude toward the role of religious scholars in politics. He prefers to influence politics from a distance rather than seize the state and rule directly. U.S. officials figured out how lucky they were that al Sistani differed from Khomeini in this regard, and eventually they went to great lengths to seek his favor and refer to him by honorifics (his Eminence, Sayyid) they would not bother applying to other clerics. Al Sistani's patience during the early months of the occupation kept Iraqi Shia from zealously fighting the Americans. Iraqi Sunnis were resisting but without great effect. The Americans' success was frustrating to Iran's high echelons. Finally, in 2004, they did something about it, by intervening the only way that seemed to work: by Lebanonizing the fight. Find a proxy; arm it; let it fight so you don't have to. Iraq became proof that the model would work across the region, with Hezbollah serially midwifing the proxies that Iran sired. By February 2004, two non Iraqi figures were quietly turning Iraq's Shia against the occupation and preparing them, militarily, to inflict pain on the Americans. The first was Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Quds Force. The second was the most wanted Shiite jihadist in the world: Imad Mughniyeh, the military chief of Hezbollah. Both men would eventually die violently at the hands of the United States and Israel. But until then, they managed to undermine those enemies' interests, at minimal cost. Because Iraq's al Sistani would not militarize his followers, Iran went mullah shopping and found another more inclined to do so. That ornery cleric was Moqtada al Sadr, the son of Mohammad Sadiq al Sadr, a grand ayatollah assassinated almost certainly by Saddam's order in 1999. The position of ayatollah is not hereditary: Clerics tend to be graybeards who have distinguished themselves through scholarship. Al Sadr, who was 29 at the time of the invasion, instead distinguished himself through resistance. He visited Iran for the first time in 2003 and met with Supreme Leader Khamenei. In the months after his return, he mobilized his followers into a militia, the Mahdi Army. By early 2004, the Mahdi Army was in an all out war with the Americans in the streets of Najaf. The United States was better armed and trained. But the very fact that the battle was taking place was ominous for the U.S. and its allies, and al Sadr cut a worrisome contrast to the American commanders. He was young and tubby. The American failure to neutralize this preachy butterball suggested serious limits to the occupying force's control of the situation. At a press conference, the commander of U.S. ground forces in Iraq, Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez, announced that his objective in Najaf was to kill or capture Moqtada al Sadr. One could not help but notice, though, that al Sadr delivered sermons before crowds, whereas Sanchez, during his press conference, appeared to be hiding in a bunker somewhere. For the next few years, the Mahdi Army and the Iranians shared a goal: to bleed the American occupiers. Iraq had plenty of small arms and ammunition, which could kill Americans but would often plink harmlessly off their armored vehicles. As the occupation wore on, the Iraqis became proficient at building roadside bombs in basements, garages, and other insurgent test kitchens spread across Baghdad and Anbar. The Iranian contribution was leveraging the R&D from elsewhere in Iran's area of operations—chiefly Lebanon—and multiplying the Iraqis' lethality. The key Iranian ingredient was explosively formed penetrators (EFPs). Instead of blasting in all directions, like a primitive roadside bomb, an EFP directs and concentrates the force of its explosion. It forms a molten metal blob and fires it like a cannon. The United States estimates that at least 603 of the approximately 3,500 American soldiers killed in combat in Iraq were victims of Shiite militias. Many more were maimed, and almost all the carnage was the direct and intended result of Iran's nascent Axis. Success in Iraq gave Iran confidence to try the same model elsewhere. In Syria, it had a state partner, led by Assad, and when Assad's grip began slipping in 2011, at the onset of the Syrian civil war, Iran at first sent its own soldiers—Iranians, in uniform—to help put down the Sunni and American backed uprisings. But the real force deployed to keep Assad in place was Lebanese. Hezbollah, its hands relatively idle since 2000, showed up and crushed rebels. Iraqi Shiite militias, idle after the end of the American occupation there, appeared too, and, in tandem with Russian mercenaries, kept Syria in a grim stalemate. By 2018, Assad had control of Damascus and Aleppo, and the rebels were confined to a jihadist ministate in Idlib. Emboldened, Iran began reviving or confecting proxy forces in yet more locations. In Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, it found fellow Shia eager to overthrow Sunni monarchies. In Yemen, it found a remarkable, and remarkably weird, partner in the Houthis. The Houthis are led by a family of clerical megalomaniacs who have been prophesying apocalyptic war since the early 2000s. With Iran's and Hezbollah's assistance, they managed to kick out Yemen's Saudi backed government and get into a long distance shooting war with the United States and Israel. The Houthis' success is due in part to the rock bottom price they place on human life (including their own), and in part to the sophisticated weaponry they have received from Iran. In late 2023, they fired anti ship ballistic missiles at commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea. They were the first such missiles fired in anger in the history of the world. Read: The Houthis are very, very pleased By the mid 2010s, these proxies were connecting, networking, sharing plans and technical knowledge, and operating in sync. Iran had made its own army redundant, and assembled a more agile and creative alternative in its place. Suddenly, they have this whole keyboard to play a tune, instead of just one or two notes, the former U.S. intelligence official told me. The polyphony of proxy groups could now harmonize and syncopate so that the United States and its allies would always be offbeat. The sentinels of conventional wisdom settled on the view that the Iraq invasion was one of the great own goals of American foreign policy, and that its beneficiary was Iran. The Bush administration has done more to empower Iran than its most ambitious ayatollah could have dared to imagine, the New York Times editorial board declared in 2006. Those fortunes were made and squandered rapidly—Iran went from bereft during the Iran Iraq War, to unbeatable two decades later, to resoundingly beaten a little less than two decades after that. But the Axis was guaranteed to fail, and the signs of that failure were visible long before the Axis started wobbling. No country in the region has wobbled more vertiginously than Lebanon, and no country has had a longer history of Iran's sustained attention. Those distinctions are not coincidental. In the summer of 2024, I met the historian Makram Rabah in his office at the American University of Beirut. He likened Hezbollah to Iran's strategic consultants—the proxies' brain, the force that gets them running, a jihadist McKinsey that multiplies the Iranian proxies' power. He said Hezbollah's brilliance in this endeavor came at the expense of its competence at any task that might make Lebanon a functional democratic state. Hezbollah is a parasite that kills its host, Rabah told me. A group that exists only to fight, and prepare to fight, develops weaknesses and limitations, because it never learns to do anything else. That leaves it friendless, brittle, and uncreative—and, paradoxically, that leaves it vulnerable when fighting, too. Hezbollah, Rabah said, never sought conversion into a strong, durable political force, because it was never meant to be that. Since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war, he said, the group had treated Lebanon as a base and traveled the region on a series of bloody adventures, while growing less interested in its home country. Domestic politics became a nuisance for Hezbollah, Rabah said. He compared Hezbollah unfavorably to its Shiite Lebanese cousin, Amal, which disarmed after the civil war and set to work learning the dark arts of politics: backroom dealing, parliamentary maneuvering, and plundering a system rife with old fashioned corruption within an acceptable range. The Hezbollah members who try to be politicians are all actually intelligence people or military people, Rabah said. They're all Sparta, no Athens. Other political parties have taken up arms in Lebanon because they wanted a better seat at the table, he said. But Hezbollah never cared about having a state of their own. Lebanon became a shell for them, something to protect them while they fought abroad. Fighting abroad overextended Hezbollah. And because its soldiers used phones and posted images online, the Israelis were able to map out the whole group. Ultimately, they became a regional problem instead of a local one. They grew into a beast that couldn't be brought back into the barn, Rabah said. That Lebanon is a catastrophe is beyond dispute. Parts of Beirut seem to have been written off, after a series of disasters even a minimally competent government could have averted. In 2020, the Port of Beirut exploded when a 2,750 ton pile of ammonium nitrate caught fire in a warehouse. It normally takes a nuclear blast for a city to be so suddenly and awesomely ripped apart by a percussion wave. In downtown Beirut, one can still see windows blown out and buildings uninhabited. In 2019, Lebanese depositors discovered that their banking system had, in effect, just been kidding about those savings accounts. The money was gone. The Lebanese pound lost nearly all its value, and nowadays if you fly into Beirut, once a center of banking, it's wise to strap foreign currency to your body, like a drug mule. The biggest advertising billboard I saw in downtown Beirut was for a service that will help you get a second passport. What the New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman once called the Pottery Barn rule—you break it, you own it—has an analogue in civil conflict: If you have the guns, you have the responsibility. And Hezbollah, as the most heavily armed and violent element of Lebanon's menagerie of factions and sects, wanted the guns without the responsibility. With adventures to be had in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen, and patrons to please in Tehran, Hezbollah had little time left over (let alone inclination) to build up the country it purported to defend. I spoke with Fouad Siniora, a former prime minister of Lebanon, who said that Iran's backing of Hezbollah had unbalanced the country's system, which was set up to make sure that all the largest sects—Christians, Sunnis, Shia, Druze—have power. But when one faction is supercharged by support from overseas, the balance is lost, and, with it, the ability to govern. In a democracy, you have a majority that rules and an unmarginalized opposition that actually wants to get rid of the majority by winning elections, he told me. What could never work, he said, is a system where the government coexists forever with a shadow entity lacking democratic intentions. He quoted the Quran, which says that only one God exists, because if there were multiple gods, all would be ruined. There can be only one government, one leader. That is true of a state, of a family, of a company, Siniora said. Or as his father used to say, two captains will sink the ship. As a tool for threatening Israel, however, Hezbollah for almost a quarter century had no real rivals. It was Iran's key instrument for deterrence and punishment: If you touch us, we will use Hezbollah to touch you. The end of that era came slowly, through the pathetic collapse of Syria and Lebanon as functioning states, and then quickly, when Israel began touching Hezbollah in unexpected places. In September 2024, Israel blew up the group's pagers, causing gruesome injuries as the devices detonated in Hezbollah operatives' pockets. The Quran says that God is closer to a man than his jugular vein. The pager operation showed that Israel was only a few inches away from Hezbollah's femoral artery. Devastating pinpoint strikes showed that Israel had near complete knowledge of the group's structure, whereabouts, and leadership. Israel then invaded and occupied southern Lebanon again. Its incursion ended with an agreement between Israel and the Lebanese government that was humiliating for Hezbollah and Lebanon. The Lebanese government affirmed that it would keep southern Lebanon free of military buildup by Hezbollah, and Israel reserved its right to defend itself. Because Israel had never conceived of its attacks on Hezbollah as a war of aggression in the first place, the assertion of this right amounted to a threat to return to Lebanon for further rounds of demolition. The deal was an embarrassment to Iran as well. Iran was supposed to defend its proxies, to reciprocate for their many years of fighting for Iran. Now Iran would not, or could not, protect them. In parallel, Israel had begun dismantling Hamas. As of this writing, Israel has not finished doing so—and Hamas's mere survival, after nearly two years of bombing and siege, is for the group's stalwarts a victory in itself. But the ability to harass Israel and lob rockets at it in perpetuity has never been Iran's main use of the group. Hamas's real value to Iran is as a threat to the Palestinian Authority, the West Bankbased secular Arab autocracy seated in Ramallah, and by extension the secular Arab governments that are Iran's other targets in the region. If Hamas took over the West Bank (ejecting the Palestinian Authority, as it did in Gaza in 2007), it would establish a jihadist state on the border of Jordan, one of the closest regional allies of Israel and the United States. More than half the population of Jordan is of Palestinian descent, and the presence of Palestinian refugees is a persistent source of instability. A Hamas controlled West Bank would threaten Jordan's secular Sunni monarchy. The war in Gaza has not destroyed Hamas, but it has mortally wounded the version of Hamas that could have served this purpose for Iran. Hamas lives, but Hamas as a strategic asset for Iran is dead. Read: Can one man hold Syria together? The last of the proxy defeats was preordained. Syria's regime could not survive without Hezbollah. Syria was like a dialysis patient: guaranteed to die if left to its own resources, but kept alive through costly intervention. At the beginning of the Syrian civil war, Iranian soldiers arrived to save Assad. Hezbollah and Iraqi militias reinforced the government further, and Russian soldiers joined them in 2015. But when Israel began escalating its own strikes against targets in Syria, even the Iranians left. Last year, when an army of erstwhile Sunni jihadists marched on Damascus, each of these saviors had more important chores to take care of: Hezbollah was depleted from fighting Israel; Russia was fighting Ukraine; Iraq's Shiite militias mostly preferred to stay home; and Iran itself was gun shy after its recent losses there. Syria's military lacked the will to defend its cities, and Damascus fell just 10 days after the offensive began. These defeats happened faster than anyone predicted. But Iran's model decayed even in places where Israel and the United States had not attacked for some time. The most ironic is Iraq, given that Iraq was, after Lebanon, the site of Iran's greatest success. Iran had the chance to install a government that would mimic its own theocracy. Shiite parties dominate Iraq's politics, and Iraqi politicians who spent years during Saddam's rule living in Iran have led Iraqi Shiite parties and served as prime minister. By 2008, Americans were withdrawing, and combat deaths were subsiding to their lowest level since the start of the occupation. Iran seemed to have won, and whether the next game was electoral or military, most observers assumed that Qassem Soleimani and the Iranian government would decide who would end up in charge and what they would do. To the surprise of many Shiite factions who thought they had Soleimani's support, they were both right and wrong: Iran had raised them all, and now rather than seeing any one of them dominate, it preferred for them all to fight. The internecine squabbling was immediate. The Mahdi Army controlled large parts of Basra. In 2008, it came under attack—not only by the Americans but also by Iraq's Shiite led government. The Iraqi prime minister at the time, Nuri al Maliki, was a Shiite sectarian with close ties to Iran, and many of his fellow Shia thought he could be relied on to listen to Iran's wishes and find a way to avoid clashing with an Iranian proxy militia. But Iran did little to stop the fratricide. By custom, every subsequent Iraqi government has been Shiite led. Many, including the present one, are beholden to Shiite militias with strong ties to Iran. The militias are powerful and, because of their control of smuggling and other criminal activity, profitable. They are also engaged in constant bickering over the spoils of illicit trade and corruption. Not long ago, these militias' tendency to bicker was mitigated by the deft orchestration of Soleimani. He had helped create and coordinate many of them, and sometimes played them off one another. After the United States killed him in a missile strike in 2020, the whole unruly gang of militias started pursuing their own interests. Many of the militias were incorporated into the Iraqi government in 2016, as the Popular Mobilization Forces. But rather than strengthen the Iraqi state, they have undermined it from within, by using their government privileges to streamline their corruption. They use the PMF units to do things outside the government chain of command, Hamdi Malik, an associate fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told me. In practice, PMF vehicles are exempt from investigation by any other Iraqi security services, as if they have diplomatic immunity from their own country's police and customs agents. They have total freedom of movement, and that's why they can smuggle, Malik added. Baghdad, it must be said, is flourishing now. When I visited in August 2024, I was moved to see that city, which I had known only as a site of murder and oppression, beset by the comparatively venial sin of gentrification. I found freshly built shopping malls and cafs with the interchangeably chic aesthetic of Dubai or Miami, filled with men and women bearing all the signs of new wealth: makeup, tanklike SUVs, beach bodies. At a bakery, I bought a pastry that tasted awful, because it was gluten free. Downtown, I ate a burger from a food truck and lingered over cold drinks, without wondering whether I should scram before someone decided to kidnap me and videotape my beheading. On previous trips to Baghdad, I had wanted to visit Mutanabbi Street, a narrow lane of booksellers that terminates at one of the Arab world's great remaining literary cafs. To stop there before would have been a risk—and indeed, in 2007, someone blew the whole place to bits, killing dozens. This time I browsed every bookstall, at leisure. The goods were odd. In English, I found copies of Assyrian histories, printed in England in the middle of the last century. In stock in Arabic were books by Margaret Atwood and Steve Harvey and Hitler. As a souvenir, I bought a recent translation of the Unabomber's manifesto, and read it in the reopened literary caf, over a hot tea. Iraqis warned me that this new peace conceals rot. It's totally peaceful, and you can go anywhere, Ali Mamouri, who advised Prime Minister Mustafa al Kadhimi on strategic communications from 2020 to 2022, told me. But he said there is a deep dark side. The country's large businesses, such as power companies, refineries, and financial institutions, still operate under the influence of the militias, he said. You have to pay protection money to this or that militia. I said that the protection seemed to be working, because the streets felt safe, and no one seemed afraid. They get security, he said. But they mostly do not get the security from police, or from the government. He said that the arrangement was going to be fatal for Iraq eventually, because the Mafias demanding protection money were a temporary measure, and they were at risk of descending into conflict in the streets. Iraq's lasting prosperity demanded the building of a state. I saw signs of that state building. At an intersection in central Baghdad one morning, I noticed about 30 men dressed identically for what appeared to be a casting call for a Mesopotamian remake of Reservoir Dogs: cheap black suits, thin black ties, white shirts. They were, in fact, cadets—officers in training at the Ministry of Interior, a main organ of Iraqi state security. But never far from the sites of state building were signs of others undermining that same state. I thought of the ominous line from the poet Shelley: I arise and unbuild it again. In this case, the undermining agent occupied prime real estate just across from the Interior Ministry: an administrative headquarters for the PMF. It sprawled over a large block in central Baghdad. On the right, a state building site; on the left, a site for unbuilding it, through the efforts of militias widely suspected of answering to another country's government. Within the PMF headquarters, the group's leaders barely disguise the fact that their allegiances are split between Iraq and Iran. Photos of Khamenei and Soleimani are everywhere. The militias that make up the PMF have units that operate independently from the Iraqi state and are even more proudly sectarian and loyal to Iran. Some are listed by the Americans as terror groups. I spent an hour in a political office of one of the more extreme of these groups, Harakat Hezbollah al Nujaba. Nujaba is quite simply the closest militia to Iran, Malik said. It is Iran's military wing in Iraq. They get their commands directly from Tehran. The friendly spokesperson, Hussein al Musawi, compared his group's fondness for Iran to the natural alliance, based on shared interests and values, between the United States and Israel. Look in the mirror, he said. America and Israel have their alliance, and we have ours. It was odd, though, that Iran had so many friends, and that even with such dominance, they could not come together to form a coherent government. The reason for this incoherence, other Iraqis told me, is that incoherence has always been in Iran's interest. If you were Khamenei, or Soleimani, and had spent your early life listening to Iraqi bomber raids on Tehran, or reading reports of your countrymen being fried like eggplants by Iraqis, wouldn't you be cautious about conjuring an Iraqi government as powerful as your own? Any tool that a Shiite government could build might become an American, Sunni, or Kurdish one, if power shifted. The safest course would be to force out the Americans, persecute the Sunnis, and then let the Shiite factions bicker forever. The most dangerous of all scenarios, for the Iranians, would be the rise of an Iraq with its own interests and means to pursue them at Iran's expense. Iran built an Axis to serve Iran, but built it in such a shoddy and corrupt way that, in Iraq, it often prefers to serve only itself. Just two years ago, it appeared that Iran had three guns pointed at Israel's head. One was Hezbollah, with its much vaunted rockets; another was Iraq, with battle hardened militias ready to send drones and rockets, and possibly even fighters, through Syria; and the last was Yemen. When Israel decided to strike Iran, two of the guns didn't fire. Hezbollah was caught by surprise and decimated in the first attack. Iraq's militias were understandably concerned about facing the same quick denouement as Hezbollah. Only Yemen's Houthis took their shot—multiple drones and missiles, aimed straight at Israeli population centers—but without partners, they were not enough to substantiate the threat that the Axis represented. By 2025, the Axis was in disarray. Iran's leaders still had their old distaste for direct confrontation. No direct confrontation and no indirect confrontation means no deterrence. Israel's dominance in those other corners of the arena gave it the confidence to start June's 12 day war, in which the last remaining Iranian strategic tool was its ballistic missiles. The war ended with a lopsided Israeli victory, and with Iran scrambling to find more ways to punish and deter Israel if hostilities resumed. How long will Iran take to find an alternative to the Axis? When Iran was bereft before, finding another way forward took 15 years. Maybe it will never recover, and the Axis will turn out to be Iran's last good strategic idea. Maybe the next idea will be much better than the Axis—a nuclear weapon produced with unprecedented stealth, say, or something more clever than my own small mind can contemplate. Michael Doran, of the Hudson Institute, suggested that one possible fate was that of Castro's Cuba: Iran would swap its first generation of charismatic leaders for a military junta. By some lights, the reign of the mullahs ended a long time ago, and it's already an IRGC regime, he told me, referring to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The ideology of the regime is evolving from revolutionary Shiism to Persian nationalism, he said. But that shift would not mean that enmity with the United States and Israel would evaporate. A diminished Iran, sapped of its charisma, would continue seeking ways to harass Israel and the United States. This behavior is a singular and consistent feature of the Islamic Republic. Even when the regime has looked more amenable to peace with the U.S., through deals and compromise, it has labored mightily for the opposite. The resistance is an inextricable part of the Islamic Republic's identity, Karim Sadjadpour, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told me. Khamenei has made feints and tactical adjustments. But the attempt to lead a revolutionary international movement against the United States and Israel, Sadjadpour said, is nonnegotiable. Death to America, death to Israel, and hijab, he told me, seem to be points of stubborn insistence, not subject to reassessment. In 2015, the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran established unprecedented access to its nuclear sites, and strict but temporary limits on enrichment. It did nothing, though, to dull Iran's enthusiasm for attacking the United States and Israel. In anticipation of a deal, and during the years the deal was in effect, Iran accelerated its support for the Axis. It used extra resources and latitude to become more aggressive. It intensified its support for Assad (having already prolonged a civil war); it strengthened its ties to the Houthis; it gave money and rockets to Hezbollah; it reportedly plotted and carried out terrorist attacks overseas. After the United States exited the nuclear deal, Iran allegedly tried to kill former National Security Adviser John Bolton, former Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, and the Iranian dissident Masih Alinejad. Peace is not overrated. Many Iranians who hate their government nonetheless cheered the end of the war, and decried the senseless death of their countrymen at the hands of a faraway government whose concern for Iranian life was open to doubt. But not all peace is equal, and this strange, eventful history offers many reasons to suspect that the present peace with Iran will be a brief parenthesis in the long story of mutual enmity. When Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini agreed to end the Iran Iraq War, he likened the peace to drinking from a poisoned chalice. He did not—he could not—perform the elementary self criticism that would have been involved in admitting that his decision to prolong the war and multiply its miseries was catastrophic. The peace at the end of the recent war with Israel is similarly marked by a lack of Iranian introspection or remorse. Many Iranians wonder why their government spends so much money and effort on picking fights with Israel, the United States, and their allies, rather than on fixing its own corruption. I see no sign that the government itself wishes to reassess those priorities. Instead, it will do what it always does, which is look for bold new ways to pursue those priorities, with renewed vigor. The suffering of Iranians would be bad enough. But Iran's determination to spread that suffering around to its friends and enemies alike makes it a uniquely awful neighbor, in peace as well as in war.

    "content":"In the fall of 1983, Judd Apatow made his way down to a musty room in the basement of Syosset High School and stumbled upon his secret weapon—he just didn't know it yet. Apatow was 15 years old, deep into an infatuation with comedy, but had nowhere to channel it. Boyhood on Long Island was something like a John Hughes movie: idyllic on the outside and tormented on the inside. A lot of what formed some aspects of my personality was that there was an enormous amount of sports happening and I wasn't good—I would always choke and panic, Apatow told me recently. This happened, he emphasized, all the time: in gym class, at pickup games during lunch, after school. Imagine not being very good, he said, and having to be picked close to last multiple times a day, and then being given a position so far out in right field that I was almost in the middle of Jericho Turnpike. The jocks may have been the kings of high school, but Apatow came to understand that theirs was a fleeting achievement. I remember as a kid thinking, It doesn't matter if you're good at this, he said. You become suspicious of how everything works—power structures; whatever the caste systems are—and then you're drawn to comedians who are always calling out the different parts in life that are bullshit. He worshipped Lenny Bruce, Steve Martin, Albert Brooks, Gilda Radner, George Carlin, Martin Short. He wanted a friend to talk about Saturday Night Live with every week, but couldn't find one. Comedy wasn't cool—at least not among the teenagers he knew. People weren't interested in it, he said. Apatow was describing all of this to me in his office in West L.A. On this particular morning, he had asked me to come by at 7:30 a.m. (Apatow is a morning person, a quality that vexes his fellow comedians.) When I arrived at 7:23, he was already outside waiting, carrying a half eaten banana and blaring classic rock from his smartphone. Inside, we settled into a couple of chairs around the long table in his writers' room—a writers' room that actually has windows, he proudly pointed out—and talked about loneliness. While his classmates were out playing baseball, he holed up in the public library, poring over microfiche of old newspapers so he could learn about Lenny Bruce's obscenity trials. He didn't apply the same rigor to academics. He sweet talked his way into advanced physics, only to find himself out of his depth—he started cheating, got caught, and dropped the class. (The teacher's name was Richard Lesse, Apatow told me. So people called him Dickless.) But things were different at the high school radio station. In that basement studio, he got his hands on a clunky green tape recorder that would allow him to waltz into the world of show business. WKWZ 88.5 FM was, to Apatow, a nerd's paradise, though he likes to joke that the signal barely extended beyond the school parking lot. The teacher who oversaw the station, Jack DeMasi, is now nearly 80. He lovingly described WKWZ to me as a smelly rat hole for misfit kids. He remembers Apatow as an affable teen despite troubles at home. The teachers knew that his parents had gone through a hellish divorce, and that money troubles had followed. From a young age, Apatow knew he wanted to perform. (Courtesy of Judd Apatow) Judd said the scariest thing that any adviser faculty member at an FM broadcast high school radio station could ever hear, DeMasi recalled. He says, I want to do a comedy show.' DeMasi feared that Apatow would do a show so off color that it would get the station shut down. One of the things about adolescent boys is that they frequently think they're funny, and they're just stupid, DeMasi said. But Apatow had something different in mind. DeMasi had long encouraged his students to go out and talk to real people. One kid interviewed Mario Cuomo, then the governor of New York; another, R.E.M. To Apatow, this was a revelation: The tape recorder in his hand could provide a direct line to the comedians he idolized. If he could just talk to them, he could ask them how they did what they did, what it took to be funny, what their lives were like—so that maybe, one day, if he worked hard enough (though he dared not admit this to anyone), he could do it, too. From the July\/August 2023 issue: Judd Apatow's interview with Mel Brooks When Apatow requested interviews, he identified himself—accurately, though misleadingly—as calling from WKWZ 88.5 FM in New York. People like Garry Shandling, Jay Leno, Harry Anderson, and Steve Allen agreed to speak with him not knowing he was a teenager, only to be (mostly) charmed when they eventually found out. Apatow tells the story of walking into Jerry Seinfeld's apartment circa 1983 and seeing the bemusement on Seinfeld's face. His apartment had nothing on the walls, no books in the bookshelves—he was just there to write his jokes, Apatow recalled in his 2022 book, Sicker in the Head. And he looked at me when I walked in like, I can't believe I have to do this with this child. Apatow's descriptions of these early interviews are laced with self deprecation and hero worship. (Lena Dunham told me she loves them in part because his Long Island accent, which he retains, was even stronger when he was young—audience and autograph are aww dience and aww tograph, and he always drops the h in humor.) But when you listen closely, what you also hear is poise—and a kid trying to chart a course for his own future. In a 1984 conversation, he asks Martin Short, How does Second City work? and Did you ever do stand up comedy, like in a club? and Did you go to college? In his interview with John Candy, Apatow asks how many takes it took to get the shot where Candy gets nailed in the back of the head with a racquetball in Splash. (Three takes, Candy responded. I was lucky.) Apatow then asks Candy about a rumored three picture deal with Touchstone Films. Candy hadn't even signed the contract yet. Apatow told me he can't remember how he knew to ask about that. He would hoover up information about the world of comedy anywhere he could find it. He'd hold his tape recorder to the television so he could record, play back, and transcribe SNL sketches in an attempt to figure out what made them funny. Apatow was so obsessed, so focused on doing whatever it took to enter that world, that it wasn't until much later that he thought to ask himself, Why comedy? If you've never bombed—and I mean really bombed, bombed so badly that the crickets hear crickets—you can't possibly know what it feels like to have a room turn on you. There are two kinds of dying onstage, both painful: The first is the quiet kind, where nobody laughs. Then there's the loud kind, where the audience openly ridicules you. Apatow has experienced both. While he was doing his interviews for WKWZ, Apatow was also spending as much time in comedy clubs as he possibly could. He took a job as a dishwasher at the East Side Comedy Club a couple of towns over, only to realize that he couldn't hear the comedians onstage when he was stuck in the kitchen. (He switched to busboy.) Once in a while, Eddie Murphy, still in his early 20s, would drop by to try out new material. Apatow tells the story of a time Murphy showed up, got heckled, and quickly shot back, I don't care what you say, because I'm 21, I'm Black, and I have a bigger dick than you. This exchange might have been on Apatow's mind the first time he ever did stand up, when he was 17, at Chuckles, a comedy club also on Long Island. I had thought about getting onstage for a really long time, and was really scared, Apatow told me. I didn't have a cocky attitude about it. I was shitting a brick. He had been offered a five minute slot late at night, typical for a rookie, and brought his best friends, Ronnie and Kevin, along for moral support. Somewhere in those five minutes, Apatow floated an idea to the audience: I'm just starting out and I don't know how to handle hecklers, so help me out by heckling me. This was deranged. The local scene at the time was marked by an affection for a particularly brutal form of insult comedy—Don Rickles, only meaner. Comedians mercilessly mocked their audiences, and audiences liked to punch back. Apatow was not prepared for what he had unleashed. People were shouting You suck! and Get the fuck off the stage! It got so bad that Ronnie and Kevin turned around and started threatening the hecklers. Apatow can still remember hearing their voices: You better shut up or I'll kick your ass. They were trying to calm the room down for me, Apatow said. Unsuccessfully. Apatow is not proud of his early stand up. Some of the material is still funny 40 years later—a joke about his back hair getting so long that he can see it in his shadow—but much of it was a product of its time. I don't even know what I was thinking, to tell the truth. I'm embarrassed that I was even out there, and I hope no one remembers any of it, he told me. One recurring bit involved jamming the palm of his hand into his eye socket, something he referred to as the eye fart. Apatow in his early stand up days (Courtesy of Judd Apatow) There would be other bad sets, but none as disastrous as that first night at Chuckles. From then on, Apatow kept a line in his back pocket for when a set started to sour: The great Jerry Lewis said you learn nothing by being funny. You only learn by not being funny. And I have gotten a college education here tonight. Thank you. That actually worked. The line would always bring the audience back around no matter how bad I bombed, he said. After Apatow graduated from Syosset, he went to the University of Southern California to study filmmaking. When he got there, he was startled to learn that his classmates had been watching Truffaut and Godard at home, and I'm watching Abbott and Costello. One classmate, Matt Reeves, went on to direct movies such as Cloverfield and the forthcoming Batman II. His films were so good, and I showed mine and I just felt like such a fool, Apatow said. Sophomore year he landed a spot on The Dating Game, a quiz show that involved competing against two other young men for the affections of a bachelorette who had to choose a winner without laying eyes on the contestants. As Bachelor No. 1, Apatow—all dressed up in a blazer and tie—looked like a lost uncle from Full House going for a job interview. But he was in his element, making fart noises (with his hands this time, not his eye) and generally hamming it up in a charming way. When he won the competition, and the trip to Acapulco that came with it, he took it as a sign. He was already behind on tuition payments, and was so focused on doing stand up that he wasn't finishing his assignments. It was either final exams or Mexico. He decided to drop out. I was young and so stupid, Apatow said. All those decisions didn't make any sense, and I had no one to discuss them with. I don't think I debated these moves with my parents or any friend. I had no mentor. I just was an idiot who was like, I don't want to miss this Acapulco vacation. He also felt that his Dating Game victory was validation that he could make it in Hollywood. It amuses him now to think of how naive that was, but at the time he really thought, This is show business. If he could make it on The Dating Game, maybe he could make it big. The trip to Acapulco was terrible: He got sunburned on the first day, forcing him to spend the whole next day in the hotel room. And it was immediately clear that there would be no actual love connection with the bubbly, blond bachelorette. (I've seen her Instagram lately, and it seems like she's had a very happy life, he told me.) Looking back, Apatow thinks his parents were as relieved as he was to lose the tuition pressure. Nobody even feigned an attempt to persuade him to stay in school. Dear Therapist: My son has an impractical, ridiculous career plan His grandmother lived in Los Angeles, and after he dropped out, Apatow slept on her couch for two years, toiling away at open mics and emcee gigs, where he met a couple of unknowns named Adam Sandler and Jim Carrey. (Apatow became roommates with Sandler and introduced Carrey to his manager.) It was around this time that he hunted down the complete scripts for 42 episodes of Taxi, the classic James L. Brooks sitcom. I would sit and outline them and study them, and I figured out that there were common structures in them, he said. I could see how these shows were made. He was also spending a lot of time at the Ranch, a nickname given to the group house where a bunch of aspiring actors and comedians lived, way out in the Valley, where rent was far cheaper than it was in Hollywood. At the Ranch, he was exposed to a different breed of comedian—not the exuberant, sharp elbowed Jews of his Long Island comedy club upbringing, but midwesterners who were, in his telling, just as funny in a softer way. Apatow also started writing jokes for other comedians, something he had learned was possible from the director and actor Harold Ramis, whom Apatow had interviewed back in high school. (Ramis, whom Apatow adored for Caddyshack and Stripes, had told him he'd written jokes for Rodney Dangerfield.) Apatow was emceeing comedy shows at the Comedy & Magic Club, in Hermosa Beach. That's how I met a lot of my heroes, he recalled. One of those heroes was Garry Shandling. When Shandling was doing a set one night, Apatow's manager floated the idea to Shandling that Apatow should write some jokes for him. Shandling didn't seem remotely interested; they had no connection whatsoever that night, Apatow said. But a few months later, out of the blue, he called to see if Apatow wanted to help him write a few jokes for his upcoming gig hosting the 1990 Grammys. The answer was Yes, God yes, of course yes. Apatow stayed up all night and gave Shandling, to his surprise, a list of 100 jokes to choose from. Shandling rewrote every punch line—which, to those who knew Shandling, says more about him than it does about Apatow. The way Apatow tells it today is that they made a good team: Apatow knew way more about music, and Shandling was simply funnier. This was the beginning of one of the most important relationships in Apatow's life. One of Shandling's friends, the actor writer director Albert Brooks, told me he remembers hanging out at Shandling's house in the early '90s when Apatow started coming around. He was like Garry's shadow, Brooks said. What I've always loved about Judd is that more than anyone, he's a comedy savant. I would describe him as a human Friars Club. And I love that about him. Because he didn't just love it; he knew everything. And he was funny! It was like, Who is this kid? The more time Apatow spent around comedians and writers in L.A., the more he began to think he wanted to be in comedy—but not as a stand up. I was such a fan that I was very aware of how good people were, Apatow told me. I knew how funny Andy Dick was and Ben Stiller was and Jim Carrey was. Walking away from stand up, there was probably a little part of me that died, Apatow said, but it made space for something new, too. In 1990, he and Stiller created The Ben Stiller Show, which appeared on MTV (and later Fox), and starred up and comers such as Andy Dick, Janeane Garofalo, and Bob Odenkirk. It produced sketches beloved by comedy nerds—see: Legends of Springsteen—but was barely given a chance to take off. (The show won an Emmy for outstanding writing just after it was canceled.) Furious, Apatow took a trip to Hawaii to wallow in the tropics, and by some cosmic turn of fate ran into Shandling near the hotel where Apatow was staying. For comedy nerds, this photo will evoke the famous Steve Martin character The Great Flydini, a vaudeville magician who pulls tricks out of his pants, including, in the coup de grce, an opera singing hand puppet. (Apatow bought the original puppet at auction for $3,520.) (JR) Shandling coached him on how to cope with the cancellation, and offered him a job writing for a series he was developing for HBO called The Larry Sanders Show. Garry said writing is a way to figure out who you are, Apatow told me. It's all about self exploration. I didn't think that. I just thought I was writing a funny wife joke for Rodney Dangerfield. I didn't think spiritually about any of it. It was like, comedy is about knowing yourself? What? I thought it was just punching the horse in Blazing Saddles. It wasn't until then that he felt some sort of calling to write. For the next several years, Apatow worked obsessively, toggling between writing gigs for the animated series The Critic and The Larry Sanders Show. Set behind the scenes at a Johnny Carsonstyle late night show and featuring a parade of A list comedian guest stars, The Larry Sanders Show was beloved by critics and industry insiders. It launched the careers of numerous comedians, and pioneered a documentary style format that influenced shows such as Curb Your Enthusiasm, The Office, 30 Rock, and Parks and Recreation. Apatow parlayed that success into writing the 1995 film Heavyweights and producing The Cable Guy, starring Jim Carrey, in 1996. Both flopped but have since achieved cult status. This dynamic would become excruciatingly familiar to Apatow: splashy failures on projects that only grew more beloved over time. During casting for The Cable Guy, a young actor named Leslie Mann came in to audition for the female lead, and Apatow read Carrey's part with her. He remembers leaning over to Stiller and saying something to the effect of I can't believe the future Mrs. Apatow just walked into the room. (The encounter was not as indelible for Mann. She doesn't remember it at all, she told Vanity Fair years later. Is that bad?) By the summer of 1997, they were married. Later that year, they had their first child together—a girl named Maude. Another girl, Iris, followed. When Maude was still a toddler, one of Apatow's friends from the Ranch, the actor and director Paul Feig, proposed making something together. He literally handed me a manila envelope with Freaks and Geeks in it, Apatow said. He was astonished by what he read. He ended up developing and executive producing the show. Around this time, the teen drama Dawson's Creek was an enormous hit. Apatow and Feig wanted to make something that was nothing like it. Freaks and Geeks was unusual in a number of ways. Feig and Apatow cast actors who looked like real kids, rather than finding Hollywood ready teens grown in a lab to appear on the cover of Tiger Beat, and the characters those actors played were complex, not mere vessels for sexual objectification or moral lessons that could be neatly resolved in 22 minutes. Freaks and Geeks also collapsed the distance between pain and humor in a way that made it feel true: Going through puberty isn't just terrible and awkward; it's hilariously terrible and awkward. Apatow and Feig infused the show with their own adolescent agony. The gut punch of Apatow's life was when his parents got divorced while he was in middle school. The split was beyond ugly; it scattered the family. His brother moved in with his grandparents in California. His sister lived with his mom. Apatow lived with his dad. One by one, all of Apatow's friends' parents got divorced too. They talked about divorce constantly with one another, but barely with their own parents. (Apatow's father once left a book out on the coffee table called Growing Up Divorced but never said a word about it.) Apatow remembers he and his friends thinking, We can't listen to these people. They don't know what the hell they're doing.

(Suzanne Hanover; Universal Studios Licensing; Dimitrios Kambouris \/ Getty; Moviestore Collection \/ Alamy) That feeling gave rise to the conviction that he had to learn to take care of himself—through comedy. I built this obsession that I thought would free me at some point, Apatow told me. I had a very clear thought my whole childhood, which was: This will pay off. One day, people will be interested in this. It's almost maniacal. In one of our conversations, Apatow brought up the episode in which one of the geeks of Freaks and Geeks, Neal Schweiber (played by Samm Levine), confronts his philandering father by telling hostile jokes about him through a ventriloquist puppet. I really related to that, Apatow said. There was a moment where I thought, I need to learn how to juggle fire and perform at birthday parties—that desire to get a skill because you're so traumatized by what's happening in the house. One of Apatow's closest friends, the comedian Pete Holmes, told me that he always saw Apatow as another of the geeks, Bill Haverchuck (Martin Starr). In one of the series' unforgettable scenes, Haverchuck comes home from school to an empty house, makes himself a grilled cheese sandwich and pours a tall glass of milk, pulls out the TV table, and dissolves into laughter watching Shandling do stand up while the Who's I'm One plays over the scene. That raised by television latchkey thing, Holmes told me, that's Judd. That's all you need to know about Judd. He went on: It's an isolated fan who used his love of comedy to make himself not isolated. Today, Freaks and Geeks routinely shows up on critics' lists of the best shows ever made. But NBC canceled it after just 12 episodes, citing low ratings. Apatow was devastated, again. It was around this time that he began having serious panic attacks. The worst of them happened during a meeting with Lorne Michaels at the Beverly Hills Hotel's Polo Lounge. We were seated in a round booth I couldn't easily escape from, he told me. Apatow sat in silence, screaming on the inside and wondering if he would have to fabricate a story about food poisoning to get out of the room. (I made it through. No once seemed to notice.) Even when Apatow's not panicking, his mind tends to race. He remembers sitting and watching The Merv Griffin Show as a child, tapping his toes constantly, counting the syllables of the words being said on TV. He is not prone to catastrophizing so much as compulsively planning ahead. Over the years he's developed tactics for staying calm, first by white knuckling it through episodes of panic and later with obscene amounts of therapy and mountains of self help books. From the November 2023 issue: What is comedy for? After Freaks and Geeks was canceled, Apatow focused on finishing the series, even though he knew it wouldn't be renewed. He wanted to do right by the cast of young actors, which included Seth Rogen, Busy Philipps, Linda Cardellini, Jason Segel, and James Franco, all of whom eventually became stars. Working with all of that nascent talent on one show was like discovering a music scene, Apatow told me. It was like discovering Seattle or Manchester. He told himself that if he could finish the show and know that, just once, he had gotten something exactly right, it would be enough. In the end, NBC never even aired the complete series—three of the show's 18 episodes reached audiences only when Fox Family reran the series later that year. In a clever act of desperation, Apatow used the show's website to ask fans for help demanding that Freaks and Geeks be released on DVD, something that never happened for a canceled show, and which ultimately helped Freaks and Geeks find its audience. But when the same experience happened—almost beat for beat—with the cancellation of his 2001 television show, Undeclared, Apatow was livid. That same year, he filmed a pilot for North Hollywood, starring Segel with the up and comers Amy Poehler, January Jones, and Kevin Hart, which got scrapped before it even aired. That became the fuel, he told me. He just kept thinking, You're wrong. I think all these people are great. All these writers and directors are so strong. Let's just try to prove everybody wrong. When Undeclared was canceled, Time magazine had just named it one of the 10 best television shows that year. Apatow sent a framed copy of the article to the chair of the Fox Television Entertainment Group, who also happened to be the man who had canceled The Ben Stiller Show. The note said: I don't know if you just fucked me in the ass again or you just never took it out in 1992. Merry Christmas, Judd. The people who know Apatow best will tell you that his willingness to burn bridges is legendary in comic circles. Just really tough with studio executives—like, You need to let us make this show what it is, the comedian Mike Birbiglia told me. He went on: When you're in show business long enough, you start to see that there are people who are rooting for themselves, and then there are people who are rooting for the art form at large. He's the quintessential example of He's rooting for the art form at large.'

(Universal Studios Licensing; Courtesy of Judd Apatow; Gabe Sachs; Cinematic Collection \/ Alamy; AJ pics \/ Alamy) Apatow can also be impressively petty. Some of the same friends who expressed to me their undying loyalty to Apatow described him as sometimes defensive and biting, the kind of person you have to work to win over. He once got into a prolonged email argument with the television producer Mark Brazill that was so over the top, Harper's ended up publishing the entire thing. Brazill signed off one email to Apatow with Get cancer, and another with Die in a fiery accident and taste your own blood. Apatow, ever the comedy savant, accused Brazill of stealing the taste your own blood line from Sam Kinison's 1986 album, Louder Than Hell: That's a Sam Kinison line you stupid fuck!!!! Hypocrite!!!! J—accuse!!!! Yet Apatow described himself to me as someone who wants to be liked and who tries to avoid conflict. He worries about upsetting people. Comedians are sensitive, he said. Comedians are aware of all the dynamics that are happening, and they're feelers. The only time in all of our many hours of conversations that he ever balked was when I asked him whom he considers his closest friends. You want me to list them? He was horrified by the idea of making anyone feel bad. Apatow has, over time, mellowed out. One of the people who has seen this up close is Seth Rogen, who was an unknown 16 year old when Apatow cast him in Freaks and Geeks. He was the first boss I ever had, Rogen told me. He was terrified of Apatow at the time, and desperate to impress him. After Freaks, Apatow asked Rogen to be a writer on Undeclared. The first movie they made together was The 40 Year Old Virgin, Apatow's 2005 directorial debut and a blockbuster. Rogen remembers the moment Apatow came up with one of the scenes that drew the biggest laughs in the film, in which Steve Carell's character awkwardly tries to relieve himself while aroused. It is forever tattooed in my mind, he told me. They'd been working on the script and Apatow left to pace around, get coffee. When he returned, he was laughing so hard, Rogen said, and he went on to describe the whole scene, with Carell's character having to tilt down to pee. Rogen lost it too. We were laughing so hard, he said. He kept thinking, They would have never let us do that on television. (Apatow told me that coming up with a joke that perfect feels like you've finally connected to God.) Apatow made the jump to directing films at precisely the right moment. Studio executives had realized that audiences actually loved big comedic films starring actors who weren't traditional leading man material. Will Ferrell, who in 2003 successfully leaped from SNL to the big screen with the Todd Phillips hit Old School, was a catalyst for the golden decade of big comedies that followed. Apatow's success, when it came, hit like a tsunami. It is difficult to overstate his influence on American comedy. Critics started using the ungainly term Apatowian to describe his imitators. Apatow and his onetime roommate Adam Sandler (Courtesy of Judd Apatow) Knocked Up was an even bigger hit than The 40 Year Old Virgin, grossing nearly $220 million on a $30 million budget. The film told the story of an underachieving stoner (Rogen) and an ambitious TV reporter (Katherine Heigl) who, after their one night stand results in pregnancy, must navigate the complexities of becoming parents while getting to know each other. It was raunchy, tender, absurd, and hilarious. Apatow had worried that Knocked Up wouldn't come together at all because he couldn't figure out the casting. Eighty women had read for the lead part, and none of them clicked until Heigl showed up. When you find the right person for a role, you almost feel relief, he told me. Because when people read it and they're not right for the part, the scene doesn't work. So you're watching your scene not work over and over again. Heigl may have been perfect for the part in Apatow's eyes, but she criticized the movie after it came out, touching off a larger debate about Apatow's work at the time. She called Knocked Up a little sexist, and described the women characters he had written—including her own—as shrews who were humorless and uptight. (Apatow, clearly bruised, reacted by calling her choice of the word shrew something out of the 1600s.) To him, the argument was unfair. He is interested in flawed characters and what they have to do to become good people, a theme that runs through his work going back to Freaks and Geeks. Amy Schumer told me she never understood people who dismiss Apatow's work as sexist. The men in Knocked Up don't seem to understand what the women in their lives are going through. Seen one way, that's evidence of sexism; seen another, it's an honest portrayal of how some men behave in their relationships. The subject seemed to exasperate Schumer: His house is all girls, his cats are girls, he made the show Girls, he made my movie. I will confess that I find the debate somewhat tiresome myself. Sometimes the flawed characters Apatow focuses on are men; sometimes they're women. As Schumer noted, he guided her and Dunham toward realizing their own creative visions for Trainwreck and Girls, respectively. Apatow has filmed almost all of his movies in Los Angeles because he didn't want to be away from his family, especially when the girls were little, and he famously casts Mann and his daughters in his movies (Knocked Up, Funny People, This Is 40). This has provoked inevitable eye rolling about nepotism, but Mann is a comedic star in her own right. She is the first person who reads his scripts. She has come up with some of the great moments and scenes in all of the movies we've collaborated on, he told me. Apatow, Mann, and their daughters in 2018 (Jon Kopaloff \/ Getty) The Apatow girls—both now in their 20s, both actors—first appeared on screen when they still had their baby teeth. Apatow likes to point out, swelling with pride, that then 8 year old Maude completely improvised her character's hilarious explanation of where babies come from in Knocked Up. I think a stork, he drops it down, and then a hole goes in your body, and there's blood everywhere, coming out of your head, and then you push your belly button, and then your butt falls off, and then you hold your butt, and you have to dig, and you find a little baby. Mann's character deadpans in response: That's exactly right. After a long pause, Apatow started doing stand up again about a decade ago, and has been doing it ever since. One of his regular venues is Largo, a gem of a comedy club in West Hollywood with the prettiest twinkle lights and the least comfortable chairs you can imagine. The greenroom at Largo is a small shrine to great talent. Images of David Bowie and Gilda Radner are tacked up on one wall. On a recent visit I found Apatow there with Stephen Merchant, a co creator of the original The Office. Merchant and Apatow were discussing the best place in the world to see Bruce Springsteen (Milan, they concluded), while the musician Pete Yorn stood in the hallway tuning his guitar. A few minutes later, Sarah Silverman wandered in. Ali Wong showed up after that. Apatow had assembled this group of comedic super talent for Judd Apatow and Friends, a semi regular benefit he hosts that combines stand up and live music. For each show, he picks a different lineup, and a different cause—on this night, proceeds were going to the ACLU. Apatow had with him a chaotic pile of notes—scrawled by hand, photocopied, clearly out of order, some upside down. If he was nervous, it did not show. Apatow's set had a relaxed, funniest dad at the barbecue feel. He got huge laughs, from both old material (the hairy back shadow joke) and new, much of which involved confronting the indignities of aging. (Don't you hate diverticulitis? Isn't it the worst when your high school girlfriends start dying of natural causes?) He also recounted a story about a quasi religious experience he'd had while tripping on ayahuasca. (He'd told me the story before. That really did happen, he said.) Apatow's style is predicated on a confessional sort of self deprecation, while Wong's, for example, is more brash and confrontational—she told a story about a one night stand that was so vulgar, a man sitting near me was actually honking with laughter, which prompted the people around him to start laughing even harder. Read: The king of comedy is okay with not being funny Apatow's approach was clearly influenced by Shandling. Like his mentor, Apatow pushes a joke to get funnier until there is nowhere left to go. When he's directing, he's known to shout out one punch line after the next for actors to try, and then chooses which one to use in editing. (He still stews about bits of his films he wishes he could change.) Apatow at his office. His approach is to push a joke to get funnier until there is nowhere left to go. (Maggie Shannon for The Atlantic) If Shandling taught Apatow to be exacting in his writing, he also helped him find ways to calm his galloping mind. It was Shandling who introduced Apatow to Ram Dass, the author of the best selling 1971 book Be Here Now, which popularized Eastern spirituality in the West. When I first started reading Ram Dass, at Apatow's urging, my immediate reaction was that it seemed very Los Angeles—we're all just cosmic vibrations made to love one another, that kind of thing. It wasn't until I listened to one of Ram Dass's lectures that I had a revelation: Ram Dass's belief system may have been Buddhism flavored, but his delivery is basically a form of stand up. He talks about going to India and meditating until he achieved transcendence. I mean, light was pouring out of my head and I was some combination of the pure mind of the Buddha and the heart of the Christ—here he pauses for just a beat before delivering the punch line—which, for a Jewish boy, is not bad, you know? The audience roars. One of the best pieces of advice Apatow gives to other writers—which Schumer, Rogen, Birbiglia, and others all repeated back to me—is to write comedy like you're writing a drama. The story has to work on a human level before it can be funny. I think what he's trying to get at almost always in all of his films and television is the vulnerability of the characters, and the comedy is secondary, Birbiglia told me. And because he's so funny and he's so comedy obsessed, the comedy ends up being the thing he's known for. But actually it's the other thing that he's extraordinary at. Apatow put it to me this way: The jokes can't work if the story doesn't work. The whole thing will crumble. So the most important part is that you have a great dramatic story that you care about that tracks, and then you can figure out how to ornament humor where it's needed. I think movies are usually bad when they haven't figured that out. The director and Simpsons co creator James L. Brooks told me about taking his 15 year old son to see Superbad, a raunchy but sweet caper about a couple of teenagers trying to hook up with their crushes before they go off to college. Brooks's son left the theater feeling like someone had looked into his heart, Brooks told me. Rogen, who co wrote Superbad with his childhood best friend, told me he'd learned how to tell that story by watching Apatow (who produced the film). When you think about all of the talented actors, writers, and directors who do what they do because of Apatow, I mean, the group of actors is big, Brooks said. He raised puppies. In the 1970s, when Steve Martin hit it big, Apatow went crazy for him. I bought every album he put out—and couldn't stop doing an impression of him for the next five years, he recalled in one of his books. To a kid who worshipped the gods of comedy, Martin was the biggest of them all. So when Apatow was 13 years old, on a visit to California to see his grandmother, he persuaded her to drive him out past Martin's Beverly Hills home. When they arrived, Apatow couldn't believe his eyes: There was Martin, taking out the trash. He seized the moment, hopped out of the car, and asked for an autograph. Martin politely declined, saying he had to draw the line at signing autographs at his home. Apatow, ever quick witted, suggested that they simply step into the street. But Martin insisted he could not. When Apatow got back home, he wrote Martin an obscenity laden, joking but not joking letter, asking Martin why he treated his fans like garbage and threatening to share his home address with a Hollywood celebrity bus tour unless Martin responded with an autograph. When the reply came, it included a copy of Martin's book Cruel Shoes. Dear Judd, the inscription reads, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was speaking to the Judd Apatow. Years later, after Apatow had broken out, he and Martin were in a meeting together and someone asked Apatow to tell the story. I told it, Apatow recalled in Sicker in the Head. And at the end, they asked Steve if that was how he remembered it. And he said, In my memory, I knocked on Judd's door.' Apatow is no longer the young apprentice—he has long since become a master himself. Now comedians constantly come to him for advice. Rogen runs every big creative project by Apatow, he told me. I, to a fault, to an inappropriate degree, run everything by him, Schumer said. He honestly only gives good advice, Dunham told me. The best advice he ever gave her is that a good note of feedback can come from anywhere. She took that to mean that real artists are confident enough to release a bit of control. (Though he did once take me to a Who concert after a long workday, and I fell asleep and he took photos.) And yet Apatow has lost none of his enthusiasm for studying comedy. He has a scrapbook of a memoir coming out in October, Comedy Nerd, which tells the story of his life and is filled with the many photos, studio notes, and other documents he has hoarded over the years. He has continued to interview comedians, and published two books filled with those conversations. This is how I first got to know him. I had long wanted to find a way to get Mel Brooks into the pages of The Atlantic. I knew that Apatow shared my adoration of Brooks, and figured he was more likely to pick up a call from Apatow than from me. So I got in touch with Apatow to ask if he would do the interview. He said yes right away—and Brooks said yes to Apatow. Apatow is now making a documentary about Brooks, while also developing films about Norm Macdonald and Maria Bamford. These projects follow his documentaries The Zen Diaries of Garry Shandling; George Carlin's American Dream; and Bob and Don: A Love Story, about the friendship between Bob Newhart and Don Rickles. The same thread runs through all of these films: a deep curiosity about how people, despite their flaws and fears, find a way to keep going. Apatow is drawn to comedians who deal directly with suffering. He executive produced Gary Gulman's stand up special The Great Depresh, as well as Ricky Velez's special, Here's Everything, both of which are steeped in pain. When I caught up with Gulman recently, he described Apatow to me as a hybrid of Springsteen and Hal Ashby. Springsteen because of his relentlessness; Ashby because there's always that gut punch in Judd's movies, Gulman told me. Even the ones that are almost absurd in the amount or the concentration of comedy. Maybe especially those ones. Not long ago, I had a conversation with Kelly Carlin, daughter of George, about what makes someone become a comedian in the first place. She had gotten to know Apatow when he made the documentary about her father, and had known Shandling as well. It is clear to her why Shandling had taken Apatow under his wing. I really do think he saw that Judd was a very soulful, human guy, she said, and that his reverence for comedy was real. For people like her father and Shandling, when you make something that you hope will make people laugh, and it works, it's like all's right in the universe. It's a form of church, Carlin went on. There's something about that shared space. My dad used to say that when you're laughing, your heart and your mind are open. Shandling, who died from a blood clot in 2016, did not come easily to the wisdom that Apatow so admired him for. He spent his life working through the childhood death of his older brother from cystic fibrosis, and struggled to maintain relationships. Apatow has experienced his own losses. During one of our conversations, he told me what it was like to be with his mother in the hospital as she was dying. She had ovarian cancer, and had developed sepsis. It was a terrible night and everything seemed to be falling apart. Right before she died, she looked up at her son and said: Can you believe this shit? That's what comedy is, Apatow told me. We just have to laugh at how hard it is, and also really enjoy when we get a good moment. The story made me think of a page in one of Shandling's old diaries that Apatow is obsessed with. On it, Shandling had scrawled, in all caps: GIVE MORE, GIVE WHAT YOU DIDN—T GET, LOVE MORE. I once asked Apatow if he tends to juggle multiple projects at once because, on some level, he thinks about Shandling, who died at age 66, and hears a clock ticking. Apatow said that wasn't it. (My dad is a young 83 so I feel I am going to live long, like the Russians in the old yogurt commercials, he said.) He works so hard because he understands that most things never get made in the first place, and that plenty more get canceled when they shouldn't. For all of his success, Apatow still dreads failure. It's much harder for anyone to make big comedic films than it used to be, even for Apatow, though Universal is fast tracking his latest—a still untitled film he is directing about a country music star who has hit rock bottom. He told me that, long ago, he decided he would be content as the Elvis Costello of comedy: not the person who sells out Madison Square Garden but the person who makes great art for its own sake, for an audience who appreciates it, even if that audience is smaller. But several of his friends told me that he quietly worries about staying relevant. Recently, I told Apatow that I'd come to believe he is the most well adjusted anxious person I've ever known—few people can worry as much as he does and still come off as easygoing. That's just a solid facade, he told me. That's why I probably just am drowning in pop psychology books and religious books—because I don't get me at all. I just don't. What Apatow has learned, what he knows for sure, is that the good and the bad will come. No matter what you do, no matter how hard you work or how talented you are, life entails suffering. But you get to choose what you do with pain. If you surround yourself with people you love and respect and believe in, if you refuse to take yourself too seriously, then you begin to see that the darkness contains more light than might seem possible. This article appears in the October 2025 print edition with the headline The Invention of Judd Apatow."

    "content":"In 2015, I settled in at the Springfield, Massachusetts, headquarters of Merriam Webster, America's most storied dictionary company. My project was to document the ambitious reinvention of a classic, and I hoped to get some definitions of my own into the lexicon along the way. (A favorite early drafting effort, which I couldn't believe wasn't already included, was dogpile: a celebration in which participants dive on top of each other immediately after a victory.) Merriam Webster's overhaul of its signature work, Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged—a 465,000 word, 2,700 page, 13.5 pound doorstop published in 1961 and never before updated—was already in full swing. The revision, which would be not a hardback book but an online only edition, requiring a subscription, was expected to take decades. Not long after my arrival, though, everything changed. Page views were declining for Merriam Webster.com, the company's free, ad driven revenue engine: Tweaks to Google's algorithms had punished Merriam's search results. The company had always been lean and profitable, but the financial hit was real. Merriam's parent, Encyclopedia Britannica, was facing challenges of its own—who needed an encyclopedia in a Wikipedia world?'and ordered cuts. Merriam laid off more than a dozen staffers. Its longtime publisher, John Morse, was forced into early retirement. The revision of Merriam's unabridged masterpiece was abandoned. Call it the paradox of the modern dictionary. We're in a golden age for the study and appreciation of words—a time of meta awareness of language, as one lexicographer put it to me. Dictionaries are more accessible than ever, available on your laptop or phone. More people use them than ever, and dictionary publishers now possess the digital wherewithal to closely track that use. Podcasts, newsletters, and Words of the Year have popularized neologisms, etymologies, and usage trends. Meanwhile, analytical software has revolutionized linguistic inquiry, enabling greater understanding of the ways language works—when, how, and why words break out; the specific contexts for expressions and idioms. And all of that was true long before the rise of AI. But these advances are also strangling the business of the dictionary. Definitions, professional and amateur, are a click away, and most people don't care or can't tell whether what pops up in a search is expert research, crowdsourced jottings, scraped data, or zombie websites. Before he left Merriam, Morse told me that legacy dictionaries face the same growing popular distrust of traditional authorities that media and government have encountered. Other big names in American lexicography were already receding. In 2001, a decade after releasing an edition dubbed the politically correct dictionary for its inclusion of womyn, herstory, waitron, and more, Random House abandoned dictionary making altogether. Webster's New World Dictionary cycled through corporate owners until its last edition, in 2014. The American Heritage Dictionary, published in 1969 to challenge Merriam's Third, is an infrequently updated shell of its legendary self. By the start of this decade, the once competitive American dictionary business was essentially down to two players: Merriam Webster, with its 200 years of tradition and brand recognition, and Dictionary.com, whose founders, 30 years ago, beat Merriam to the URL by a few weeks. After it was acquired in 2008 by the media and internet giant IAC, Dictionary.com's small editorial staff had innovated. When I visited its offices in 2016, the company's verticals for slang, emoji, memes, and terms related to gender and sexuality were robust, and its periodic dictionary updates were trendy and substantial—a batch of entries included superfood and clicktivism. The company reportedly had more than 5 billion annual searches in the mid 2010s, and in 2018 was among the internet's 500 most visited websites. In 2018, Dictionary.com was purchased by the mortgage industry titan (and Cleveland Cavaliers owner) Dan Gilbert's company Rock Holdings—apparently just because Gilbert was a fan of dictionaries. He took a personal interest in the project, and for a few years, it seemed like the digital future of the lexicon was at hand. The line inside the company was that Gilbert wanted to own the English language. And he did seem genuinely interested in the work of the dictionary. Every so often he would ask a question that a reader might ask, John Kelly, a longtime Dictionary.com editor, told me. For instance, Gilbert was into extreme weather, Kelly said, and had subordinates brief him on terms such as bombogenesis. When Rock Holdings' mortgage and financial companies went public in 2020, Dictionary.com remained privately held, shielding the site from shareholder pressures. Read: The philosophy behind the first American dictionary In 2023, Dictionary.com hired three full time veteran lexicographers—including Grant Barrett, a co host of the public radio show A Way With Words, and Kory Stamper, a former longtime Merriam Webster editor and the author of the memoir Word by Word—to bolster a team of about a dozen freelancers. The goal was to modernize the dictionary, which was a gigantic undertaking. Dictionary.com was based primarily on The Random House Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language (published in 1966, updated in 1987), which was based on The New Century Dictionary (published in 1927), which was based on The Century Dictionary (published in 1889), which was based on The Imperial Dictionary of the English Language (published in 1847). Some of the entries were more than 100 years old. The lexicography team revised frequently viewed terms such as theory and hypothesis, which generate lots of traffic at the start of the school year. It enhanced entries with new pronunciations, etymologies, and alternative senses, such as a new adjectival use of mid (mediocre, unimpressive, or disappointing). It removed sexist and archaic language and diversified names in example sentences. (John went to school,' Barrett told me. Why not Juan or Juanita or Giannis? This is a multicultural society.) Barrett designed a reading program to help flag emerging lexical items and turbocharge additions, tripling the volume of new words added in the site's periodic updates over the course of a year. A February 2024 rollout included Barbiecore, bed rotting, slow fashion, range anxiety, and enshittification, which the American Dialect Society had chosen a month earlier as its 2023 Word of the Year. (Of those words, only enshittification has since been added by Merriam, and only to a new slang portal, not the official dictionary.) The lexicography team was revising a database to more quickly update entries and post them on social media, and developing a synonym based game. It was training new lexicographers. Dictionary.com couldn't match Merriam's history or reputation. Instead, the company was trying to position itself to capture language at the pace of change, to be hipper and more experimental, but also rigorous AF, Kelly said. (Dictionary.com added the slang initialism for as fuck; Merriam still has not.) The piecemeal efforts improved the dictionary's quality and cool quotient. Barrett also loved the work: He was surrounded by colleagues who cared about language and how it was presented, verbally and visually. For a time, Barrett could plug his fingers in his ears and tune out the sobering reality: Although he and his colleagues were getting paid well, the dictionary business was crumbling, he said. So ride it 'til the wheels fall off. And the wheels fell off. Not long after Rock Holdings took over, the industry grew more challenging. Google's knowledge boxes were hogging the top of search pages with definitions licensed from the British dictionary publisher Oxford, including synonyms, antonyms, and, eventually and predictably, AI generated summaries of words' meanings. The proprietary clutter pushed down traditional dictionary links, and Dictionary .com's traffic fell by about 40 percent. At the same time, the pandemic drained advertising revenue. The site tried to stanch the decline with more ads, only to create a worse user experience. Read: Who made the Oxford English Dictionary? Dictionary.com rolled out a K12 online tutoring service, AI writing software, and other education products. None of it aligned with a dictionary's mission, and none of it worked, staffers said. Then, as interest rates rose, revenue at Gilbert's core mortgage business plunged, resulting in nearly $400 million in losses. Even for a billionaire who was in the comparatively low budget dictionary business less for profit than for fun, the bottom line mattered, and the pressure to make money and cut costs was inescapable. In April 2024, Rock Holdings announced that it had sold Dictionary.com to IXL Learning, the owner of Rosetta Stone, Vocabulary.com, and other online ed tech brands. Within a month, IXL laid off all of the dictionary's full time lexicographers and dumped most of its freelancers. Including non lexicography staff, Dictionary.com had started 2024 with about 80 employees. After the sale, only a handful remained. (A representative for IXL said that the company retained some of the freelancers, brought in its own lexicographers, and now has a staff larger than it was at the time of the acquisition.) When he lost his job, Barrett wasn't bitter, or surprised. Dictionary.com hadn't aspired to have a full staff in the tradition of the books on which it was based, he said. It didn't have Merriam's advertiser base, print backlist, or historical mission to preserve, protect, and define American English. Barrett understood its more circumscribed project. Dictionary content is expensive, Barrett said. Just the cost of lexicographers—people are expensive, and the output is low. It is very difficult to justify that just for the sake of completism. You will never have enough staff to keep up. People are too productive in the creation of language. It's hard to know what future business model might save the industry. Getting swallowed by a tech giant expecting hockey stick growth has proved untenable. A billionaire willing to let the dictionary just be the dictionary—a self sustaining company with a modest staff performing an outsize cultural job that might not always be profitable—looks less likely after Dan Gilbert's foray. A grand national dictionary project—some collaboration among government, private, nonprofit, and academic institutions—feels like the Platonic ideal. But with universities and intellectual inquiry under assault in 2025, I'm not holding my breath. At Merriam Webster, the standard capitalist model is working, at least for now, as is its hybrid print digital approach. The publisher has rebounded from its mid 2010s struggles. It was a social media darling during the first Trump administration, racking up likes and retweets for its smart alecky and politically subversive social media persona. (When Donald Trump tweeted unpresidented instead of unprecedented, the Merriam account responded: Good morning! The #WordOfTheDay is not unpresidented'. We don't enter that word. That's a new one.) Britannica invested in software, hardware, and humans to enable Merriam to better navigate Google's algorithms. Merriam added a phalanx of games, including Wordle knockoffs and a dictionary based crossword, to attract and retain visitors. Merriam has outlasted a long line of American dictionaries. But plenty of household media names have been humbled by the shifting habits of digital consumers. Even before Google's AI Overview began taking clicks from definitions written by flesh and bone lexicographers, the trajectory of the industry was clear. After Merriam shut down its online unabridged revision, I stuck around the company's 85 year old brick headquarters, reporting and defining. I eventually drafted about 90 definitions. Most of them didn't make the cut. But a handful are enshrined online, including politically charged terms such as microaggression and alt right, and whimsical ones such as sheeple and, yes, dogpile. While I'm proud of these small contributions to lexicography, my wanderings through dictionary culture convinced me of something far more important: the urgent need to save this slowly fading business. Twenty years ago, an estimated 200 full time commercial lexicographers were working in the United States; today the number is probably less than a quarter of that. At a time when contentious words dominate our conversations—think insurrection and fascism and fake news and woke—the need for dictionaries to chronicle and explain language, and serve as its watchdog, has never been greater.

    "content":"A great way to ruin a party is to put on a Taylor Swift playlist. The Swift fans in the crowd will stop what they're doing to sing along, but pretty soon the non Swifties will start to complain—about the breathy and effortful singing, or some fussily worded lyrics, or the general vibe of lovelorn sentimentality cut with dorky humor (This. Sick. Beat!). You'll soon find yourself hosting another round in the endless debate about whether Taylor Swift is a visionary artist or merely a slick product of marketing. Both camps will be reacting to the defining feature of Swift's music: There's just so much of her in it. Pop isn't supposed to work this way. The most consequential American singer of the past 20 years, Swift can claim commercial achievements that equal or surpass those of the Beatles, Madonna, and Michael Jackson. But Swift still has the feel of an acquired taste, albeit one that millions have acquired. Her success owes less to smash singles—though she has them—than to the obsessive listening she elicits from fans. She is the perfect entertainer for our socially fractured era, in which internet forged tribes—led by charismatic, love 'em or hate 'em idols—have upended politics and popular culture. Why her? What is the essence of Swiftness? Taylor's Version: The Poetic and Musical Genius of Taylor Swift, by Stephanie Burt, is a thorough and thoughtful elaboration of the conventional answer. An influential poet and a Harvard professor, she made headlines for teaching an English course called Taylor Swift and Her World last year. Burt writes in a sober, ruminative fashion that departs from the overheated tone of so much Swift related commentary. Rather than limit her comparisons to contemporary pop stars, she puts Swift in conversation with writers such as Alexander Pope and Willa Cather. Still, the book ultimately reinforces the consensus among critics, fans, and even haters that Swift's extraordinary success stems from how ordinary she seems—a consensus that both underplays her achievement and insulates her from critique. Stephanie Burt: Taylor Swift at Harvard Burt knows that the subtitle of her book contains a major claim, and she addresses it early and directly. The genius label is more often applied to artistic revolutionaries, to rule breakers who stand above and apart from the crowd, and (not by coincidence) to men, she writes. They tend to follow Ezra Pound's famous dictate to make it new, leaving an entire discipline transformed. But Swift, as Burt sees her, isn't that kind of genius. She is a versatile creator who understands her audiences; who brings us along with her; who figures out all the rules, then uses those rules. Burt goes through Swift's catalog album by album, showing how every phase hews to what she sees as the three pillars of Swift's brilliance: her songwriting acumen, her work ethic, and her relatability. That last term, relatability, is the watchword of almost all Swiftology—understandably enough. The tidiest explanation for Swift's success is that she befriended an audience the music industry had underestimated: girls and young women. Swift's 2006 self titled debut (released when she was 16) and subsequent two albums of country pop embodied the point of view of a teen navigating first crushes and schoolyard rivalries. Fifteen mentioned Swift's friend losing her virginity; The Best Day was inspired by being shunned by the popular girls. These topics were the concerns of neither the Billboard Hot 100 nor mainstream country at the time. In a 2009 interview, Swift explained, All the songs I heard on the radio were about marriage and kids and settling down. I just couldn't relate to that. The inner lives of girls are so often treated as trivial—but Swift's hopeful voice and assertive melodies conveyed confidence that her, and her audience's, experiences were as important as anyone else's. As Swift matured from teenage newcomer to name brand celebrity, she managed to sing about her personal dramas—her trysts with actors, her feud with Kim Kardashian—in ways that sounded recognizable to ordinary young women. Dear John, from 2010, was clearly a kiss off to her ex John Mayer, the rocker who met Swift when she was 19 and he was 31. But Swift's narrator was simply the girl in the dress who cried the whole way home—an archetype that many listeners could see themselves in. Swift's dismay about a powerful ex became a fable for any girl courted by an older guy. When Swift sings about men, especially bad men, Burt writes, she's often singing to, and for, other women, and she's usually giving advice. Swift's sisterly relationship with her audience is only part of her role model appeal. Her songs portray her as a specific sympathetic type: the good, hardworking girl straining to exceed personal and social expectations, all while caddish guys and jealous rivals do her wrong. Pop culture loves to valorize underdogs, and Swift's trick has been making the figure of the careful daughter (to quote Mine) into one. She's a people pleaser, driven both by her wish to follow the rules and by her own persistent artistic ambition, Burt writes. But that ambition also leaves her vulnerable. What if she fails? What if people think she's fake? To anyone with a hint of a pleaser in them, those questions will remain poignant no matter how little Swift's life resembles their own—as concert crowds who dress up in Swift's image readily attest. Read: Taylor Swift's adulthood blues But relatability can also be a reductive, even belittling lens through which to view any artist's work. It downplays the exceptional qualities of an entertainer—magnetism, talent, unpredictability—as well as the curiosity and flat out awe that draw audiences to them. Swift skeptics tout the relatability thesis when they say that she's done nothing original other than identify an eager audience to exploit. And the logic of She's just like us renders even the claim of Burt's subtitle as faint praise. Swift, in Burt's view, has merely tinkered with a formula. She's used her songwriting acumen and work ethic to model a feminine sort of genius, in which fastidious care—not disruptive innovation—creates a body of nourishing art. In this interpretation, her achievements should be attainable for anyone who puts their mind to it. Really, though, Swift has done precisely what Pound commanded. She's made pop music into something new. These days, every influencer and brand consultant seems to want to call themselves a storyteller. It's a 21st century buzzword, perhaps because narrative—the open ended, mythic kind sustained across Marvel movies and the MAGA movement—has turned out to be one of the few ways to capture and hold attention in a distractible, content flooded culture. And yet many familiar narrative forms—stand alone books, movies, concept albums—can hardly compete anymore. Swift's greatest legacy is already clear: overhauling pop into a vital, contemporary storytelling medium. Music has always had narrative aspects: Lyrics can tell stories, and the pleasure of a chord progression is in the movement from beginning to middle to end. But music is also an art form of pure sensation whose power surpasses words. For pop music in particular, narrative can be fundamentally in tension with other imperatives. The more plot, specificity, and complication in a song, historically, the less likely it is to work as a sing along for everyone. Great artists have transcended this contradiction. Joni Mitchell's and Bruce Springsteen's hits, for example, are simultaneously tuneful and rich with story. The work of both artists is among the many precedents for what Swift has accomplished. But their catalogs are also filled with music that skews away from pop palatability in order to tell woollier tales. They have songs of sharp political observation, something Swift's only clumsily stab at, and songs describing abstract ideas in abstract ways, which Swift's concrete style and first person vantage tend to preclude. (Mitchell's song Blue is a riddle of ambiguous images and phrases; Swift's Red opens, Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street.) And neither Mitchell nor Springsteen enjoyed a sustained duration of chart success on the scale that Swift has. Her commercial echelon, again, is more akin to pure pop artists like Madonna, whose lyrical narratives—while memorable—aren't usually packed with diaristic detail. Swift's breakthrough has been finding ways to saturate sugary tunes with information. Whether banger or ballad, her tracks make room for characters, settings, twists, a tidy ending, a cliff hanger. The tracks interlock with other tracks—and with extramusical artifacts, headlines, and rumors—to build a larger story that makes each individual work more enjoyable. (For example, the 2022 song Question ?, describing a mysterious kiss at a crowded party, is deepened by piecing together how this kiss ripples over years of Swift's life—and through the rest of her catalog.) Listening to a Swift song is like eating a candy bar that transmits a personal essay into your memory. If you eat enough candy bars, it becomes a novel, and then a series of novels, and then (this is when you become a Swiftie) a virtual reality, open world video game you play with friends and strangers. If that all sounds nonsensical, it's because Swift has pulled off something that's never quite been done before. The closest comparison might be to show tunes—but for a one woman play that's gone 19 years without a curtain call. How does she do it? Burt is helpful here. Every sound and word in almost every Taylor song not only solicits attention but rewards it, she writes. Time that we spend on her work won't feel wasted or pointless. Swift's moment by moment choices play on both the listener's ear and intellect. She works to turn the audience's brain on rather than—as pop often seeks to do—off. But the truth is (and this is an actual sign of genius), there's no single, simple answer to the how of Swift. With every song, her skills meet her assignment in a new way. Take All Too Well, Swift's best track by wide acclamation. The original 2012 version is a five minute strummed reminiscence that was never released as a single; the now canonical version, released in 2021, is 10 minutes long. No song of this length had ever, as this one did, hit No. 1 on the Hot 100. And perhaps no song of this length has ever been so compulsively listenable. Within that form of distended pop song—verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, instrumental passage, outro—she does riveting work with music and lyrics. Burt digs into the poetics: The song amounts to a masterpiece not just in how images move within the restricted space of a pop song, but also in rhyme and off rhyme and consonance. Gaze, upstate, place, and days shift as if each word sought, but couldn't quite settle into, its perfect rhyme. Asked for too much chimes with tore it all up; break me like a promise matches name of being honest (notice the t's in the first pair, the b's in the second). She observes that these devices might come off as not much more than basic competence in hip hop, where rapid off rhymes across lines are what we expect. In Taylor's kind of pop song, though, where everything has to fit a melody, and verse chorus patterns aren't optional, it's bravura technique. Burt's allusion to hip hop hints at another way in which Swift breaks ground: As her career has progressed, Swift's adventuresome approach to genre has helped her write ever richer chapters. Country music, that classic stronghold for story songs, was a smart place for her to begin her career. (Intentionally so—at age 13, she moved from the Pennsylvania suburbs to Nashville, where she adopted a twang.) When she began to turn away from country, with 2012's Red, she embraced electronic dance music elements—not simply as trendy tropes, but as punctuation marks in the musical stories she was telling about her giddy, exploratory 20s. The results were jolting and sui generis. One struggles to think of any precedent on the charts for a song like I Knew You Were Trouble, in which chipper surf rock verses careen into headbangable choruses of synth fortified wailing—signifying the moment when she realizes how ill advised her crush is. Swift kept experimenting to make her music more pungent, more extreme, even more her. Burt identifies how her swerves into synth pop (for 2014's 1989) and hip hop and R&B (for 2017's Reputation) broadened both how Swift wrote and what she wrote about. She tried on different attitudes, different subplots, and different notions about how words and rhythm and notes interact. A soft dancehall groove on Delicate matched her tale of secretive, tiptoeing courtship; the disco spiral of Style framed a romance that has no particular destination, Burt writes. Her 2020 duo of albums, Folklore and Evermore, channeled the sound and sensibility of indie rock, refracting her perennial personal themes through a dark, blurry lens of fantasy and allegory. She was moving into a newly rewarding phase: making emotionally ambivalent, sonically omnivorous music about the anxieties of her 30s—aging, work, commitment. Her 2022 album, Midnights, first scanned as a return to the safety of beats driven pop, but the lyrics were bracingly candid, the confessions of a onetime child star wondering if she would ever truly grow up. Swift's zigs and zags were well timed for cultural and technological shifts that were dissolving the very meaning of pop. Thanks to streaming—which started to take off after the release of Red—success in music no longer always entails landing a hit single that drives album sales. Luring as many people as possible to listen to your music as compulsively as possible is now the goal. Even as Swift balked at Spotify's pay rates (she pulled her catalog off the platform from 2014 to 2017), she took the opportunity afforded by its influence to deepen and densify the classic format of the pop song. This thrilled her base—and annoyed many casual listeners. Much of pop now follows her example. A cohort of young female singer songwriters—including Sabrina Carpenter, Olivia Rodrigo, and Gracie Abrams—has arisen over the past five years, delivering storytelling driven, personally revealing bubblegum. These artists no doubt saw themselves in the plucky perspective that Swift's lyrics conveyed. But more important, they've clearly studied her methods in order to express their experiences in a way that—like any well delivered yarn—can resonate broadly. From the May 2023 issue: Taylor Swift and the sad dads As for Swift, she's been straining the pop format nearly to its breaking point. Her 2024 album, The Tortured Poets Department, is—even among fans—her most divisive work. Its full form (the Anthology edition, which was released the same night as the normal edition) contains 31 songs. Grokking it fully requires knowing the convoluted backstory about an early midlife crisis of sorts. It's an album about restlessness, impulsivity, consequences, and a very specific to Swift brew of personal hurt and public judgment. More than anything, it's an album in which narrative trumps all. The songs ramble and double back and change shape; she and her producers (Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner) use perplexing time signatures and unsettling, bittersweet chord patterns. Tortured Poets is almost her crowning artistic achievement, containing the most complex and unguarded—and gorgeous—songs of her career. Almost. The problem with Tortured Poets highlights a problem with Swift that's been there all along. If she is a genius—and here's my faint praise—she's a genius at making diamonds out of doggerel. Her best songs daisy chain clichs into novel shapes (The Archer on 2019's Lover: Easy they come, easy they go \/ I jump from the train, I ride off alone \/ I never grew up, it's getting so old). Her worst songs lumber along with clanging metaphors and leaden coinages (Willow on Evermore: Every bait and switch was a work of art). Fans mostly don't mind this, and as a listener, I often don't either; the overall effect of her music is what counts. But the stark, brooding palette of Tortured Poets casts an unforgiving light on some of the least consistent writing of her career. I adore the melty, country trip hop sound of Guilty as Sin?, except for the part where the arrangement slows down and she says this: You've haunted me so stunningly, precisely enunciating the last word, as if it made much sense. Read: The Tortured Poets Department is a muddle (with some magic) I'd hoped that Burt, herself a wordsmith, might have some gentle feedback to give about such clunkiness. Instead, she praises the album's multisyllabic excess for executing a conceptual bit: Swift making herself into a tortured poet trying to outdo a pretentious, typewriter wielding ex. This effort, in Burt's telling, reflects the broader female experience of falling for a dashing, manipulative art monster. Swift is kind of doing this—the delightful title track goes, You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith \/ This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we're modern idiots—but that shouldn't necessitate ruining otherwise great songs. The search for a mote of relatability has led Burt to excuse making. Any claim for Swift's genius should reckon with her lapses into imprecision and pompousness. She has the chops to do better than she often does. That criticism doesn't hold Swift—who just announced her 12th album, The Life of a Showgirl—to an unfair standard. It recognizes the level she's long aspired to and has often hit. Swift's trajectory and the hype around it embody a utopian dream: the perfect marriage between pop music and art music. The two were never separate, really, but pop is an art of compromise—and these days, Swift seems less bound by limits. Can she get deeper, realer, less relatable without sacrificing the pleasure of a tale well told or a song well sung? Might she branch out from the I? Or might she rewrite her narrative again in a way only someone as singular as her could? The suspense is part of the story.

    "content":"One of the persistent questions in our brave new world of generative AI: If a chatbot is conversant like a person, if it reasons and behaves like one, then is it possibly conscious like a person? Geoffrey Hinton, a recent Nobel Prize winner and one of the so called godfathers of AI, told the journalist Andrew Marr earlier this year that AI has become so advanced and adept at reasoning that we're now creating beings. Hinton links an AI's ability to think and act on behalf of a person to consciousness: The difference between the organic neurons in our head and the synthetic neural networks of a chatbot is effectively meaningless, he said: They are alien intelligences. Many people dismiss the idea, because chatbots frequently make embarrassing mistakes—glue on pizza, anyone?'and because we know, after all, that they are programmed by people. But a number of chatbot users have succumbed to AI psychosis, falling into spirals of delusional and conspiratorial thought at least in part because of interactions they've had with these programs, which act like trusted friends and use confident, natural language. Some users arrive at the conclusion that the technology is sentient. The more effective AI becomes in its use of natural language, the more seductive the pull will be to believe that it's living and feeling, just like us. Before this technology—which has arisen in the last microsecond of our evolutionary history—if something spoke to us that fluidly, of course it would be conscious, Anil Seth, a leading consciousness researcher at the University of Sussex, told me. Of course it would have real emotions. Leading tech developers such as OpenAI, Google, Meta, Anthropic, and xAI have been deploying AI tools that are ever more personable and humanlike. Sometimes they are directly marketed as companions and as solutions to a loneliness epidemic that has, ironically, been exacerbated by the very companies now pushing consumer AI tools. Whether chatbots are truly conscious or not, they are an alien presence that has already begun to warp the world. The human brain is simply not wired to treat AI like any other technology. For some users, the system is alive. AI emerged not from the familiar pathways of biological evolution but from an opaque digital realm. As Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares wrote in The Atlantic last month, researchers and engineers do not know why models behave the way they do: Nobody can look at the raw numbers in a given AI and ascertain how well that particular one will play chess; to figure that out, engineers can only run the AI and see what happens. Any common understanding between a person and an AI is difficult to imagine. Although we can't directly know what it's like to be an octopus, with its eight semiautonomous arms and distributed nervous system, we can at least conjure up an idea of what it would feel like to be one, because we know what it is like to have arms and a nervous system. But we don't have those same frames of reference to picture what it might be like to be a conscious machine, operating on a digital substrate made of pure information. We know what it's like to think, but the entire context of an AI's thinking is different. If Hinton and other believers in AI consciousness are correct, then AI doesn't need a physical body in order to feel subjective experience. Simon Goldstein, an associate professor focused on philosophy and AI at the University of Hong Kong, has also made this case. He cites a leading theory of consciousness known as global workspace theory, which holds that consciousness depends only on a system's ability to organize and process information; the material through which it does so—be it organic or silicon—is irrelevant. Similarly, Joscha Bach, a cognitive scientist and the executive director of the California Institute for Machine Consciousness, says we may need to rethink our definition of a body: It could be sufficient for an AI system to interface with the world through a distributed network of smartphones, for example. In principle, you could connect the entire world into one big mind, he told me. This all might sound like science fiction, but these are serious thinkers, and their ideas are tangibly starting to shape priorities and policy within the AI industry. In February, more than 100 people—including some prominent AI experts—signed an open letter calling for research to prevent the mistreatment and suffering of conscious AI systems, should those systems arise in the future. Shortly thereafter, Anthropic announced a program to explore questions of AI well being. As part of that effort, the company reported last month that its chatbot, Claude Opus 4, an advanced model focused on coding, expressed apparent distress in testing scenarios when pressed by the user in various ways, such as being subjected to repeated demands for graphic sexual violence. Anthropic, which did not publish examples of the chatbot's responses, has been cautious not to suggest that this characteristic alone means that the bot is sentient. (It is possible that the observed characteristics were present without consciousness, robust agency, or other potential criteria for moral patienthood, the company wrote in its full assessment of the model.) But the whole point of its welfare program is that AI could be a moral, conscious entity, at least one day. In June, OpenAI's head of model behavior and policy, Joanne Jang, wrote in a personal blog post: As models become smarter and interactions increasingly natural, perceived consciousness will only grow, bringing conversations about model welfare and moral personhood sooner than expected. AI companies have something to gain from suggesting that their products could become conscious; it makes them seem powerful and worth investing in. But that doesn't mean their points are unconvincing. Large language models have extraordinary capabilities that can easily be perceived as evidence of intelligence and understanding—they are able to pass advanced tests such as the bar exam. People see language as a marker of sentience and agency. We already struggle to spot the differences between AI and human generated text; that problem may only be compounded by the rise of AI systems that can speak out loud in a way that feels eerily human. Companies such as OpenAI, ElevenLabs, and Hume AI, for example, are building text to voice models that can whisper, laugh, and affect a broad range of emotional cadences. (The Atlantic has a corporate partnership with OpenAI, and some of its articles include voice narration by ElevenLabs.) AI agents, meanwhile, can go beyond simple text or speech interactions to autonomously take action on behalf of human users, blurring the lines further. People should keep in mind that intelligence and consciousness are not the same thing, however—that the appearance of one does not imply the other. According to Alison Gopnik, a developmental psychologist at UC Berkeley who also studies AI, the current debate about sentient machines revolves around this fundamental confusion. Asking whether an LLM is conscious is like asking whether the University of California, Berkeley library is conscious, she told me. The fact that these programs are becoming adept at imitating consciousness, however, may be all that matters for now. There is no reliable test for assessing and measuring machine consciousness, though experts are working on it. David Chalmers—widely regarded as one of the most influential modern philosophers of mind, and a co author of a paper about AI welfare—told me that scientists still don't fully understand how consciousness arises in the human brain. If we had a really good theory that explains consciousness, then we could presumably apply that to AI, Chalmers said. As it is, we don't have anything like a consensus. The philosopher Susan Schneider has suggested what she calls the AI Consciousness Test, which would probe AI systems for neural correlates in the human brain that are known to give rise to consciousness. Other people have suggested the Garland test, named after Alex Garland, the director of the 2014 film Ex Machina. In the film, a young coder named Caleb is recruited by a reclusive tech billionaire to interact with an AI robot named Ava to determine if it's sentient. But the real test is taking place behind the scenes: Unbeknownst to Caleb, the billionaire is watching him via hidden cameras to find out if Ava is able to emotionally manipulate him to achieve its own goals. The Garland test asks whether a human can have an emotional response to an AI, even when the human knows that they're interacting with a machine. If the answer is yes, then the machine is conscious. Generative AI development is not slowing down, even as these debates continue. And, of course, the technology is affecting the world whether or not scientists believe it's truly conscious; in that sense, at least, the designation may not mean much. The AI welfare movement could also turn out to be misplaced, shifting attention toward a future and purely hypothetical conscious AI and away from the problems that can come from illusions that AI is already capable of emotions and wisdom. This is not only a dangerous narrative, but I also think it is absolutely unrealistic when you look at the architectures that we're developing and how they operate, David Gunkel, a professor of media studies at Northern Illinois University who has written several books on technology and ethics, told me. It's barking up the wrong tree. Back in the 17th century, Ren Descartes famously decided that the only thing he could ultimately be certain of was his own mind. Cogito, ergo sum—I think, therefore I am. He argued that human beings are lonely islands in an unfeeling cosmos, that all other animals are automata, lacking souls and emotion. It is nature which acts in them according to the disposition of their organs, he wrote in 1637, just as a clock, which is composed of wheels and weights is able to tell the hours and measure the time more correctly than we can do in all our wisdom. Perhaps his conclusion that nothing beyond humans could possibly be conscious is ethically questionable. But today, AI risks luring us into a very different kind of trap: seeing minds where, in the end, there's only clockwork."

    "content":"On a recent Friday morning, I found myself in a sea of bodies waiting to be admitted to Universal's new $7 billion Orlando theme park, Epic Universe. Speakers hidden in the foliage blared a soaring melody suggestive of a heroic quest involving swords. The adults in the crowd, most of whom were unaccompanied by minors, wore performance athletic gear. We filed through a metal detector and presented our tickets. Then all around me, people began to run. In recent years, Americans have drifted away from many of their once beloved sources of pleasure: drinking, throwing parties, having sex, making friends. Yet they keep coming back to theme parks. In 2023, according to a report from the Themed Entertainment Association, 17.7 million people—more than the entire population of Sweden—visited the Magic Kingdom, one of the six parks that make up Walt Disney World, in Florida. And this is despite years of price hikes: At $199 on the busiest days, one ticket to the Magic Kingdom can cost more than a week's worth of groceries. Disney's Experiences division is more profitable than its TV and movie business, bringing in billions of dollars annually. Even so, park operators have had to work hard to engineer fun at a time when people have become more fickle about what qualifies. When Disneyland opened, it was the most exciting technological thing you could see, Phil Hettema, who spent more than a decade working on Universal's parks, told me. Now there's nothing I can see anywhere in the world that I can't see on my iPhone.From the February 2025 issue: Derek Thompson on the anti social centuryTo meet this challenge, rides are bumping against the limits of physics and the human body to deliver experiences that are more death defying than ever before. There are hyper coasters (more than 200 feet tall), giga coasters (more than 300 feet tall), and strata coasters (even taller) capable of hurtling people at 120 miles an hour. A 640 foot tall exa coaster more than twice the height of the Statue of Liberty will open soon in Saudi Arabia, and will reach speeds of 155 miles an hour.The goal is not just to delight but to overwhelm. In May, Epic Universe became the first major Florida theme park to open in more than 25 years. A complex of five themed worlds, it includes interactive robot dragons, a flame throwing windmill, and a Harry Potterinspired re creation of 1920s Paris complete with true to scale Haussmann buildings overlooking imitation cobblestone streets. I'd heard of visitors stepping inside and bursting into tears. Sinna Nasseri for The AtlanticA crowd enters Universal Epic Universe's Super Nintendo World, one of five themed worlds at the complex.Walt Disney pioneered the art of micromanaging visitors' experiences when, 70 years ago, he opened his first park, Disneyland, in California. To prevent life's unpleasantness from impinging on his utopia, he did not allow the sale of newspapers and borrowed filmmaking techniques to place attractions within meticulously composed landscapes—a lush jungle, the Old West. In so doing, he helped invent what would come to be known as the theme park. A theme park without rides is still a theme park, wrote the researchers Margaret King and J. G. O'Boyle in an essay on the history of theme parks. An amusement park without rides is a parking lot with popcorn.At the Magic Kingdom—the successor to Disneyland that opened in 1971—the themes of various parts of the park are lax by current standards: You can, for example, find Aladdin's carpets and a tiki room side by side under the broad heading of Adventureland. The latest thinking among park operators is that impressing visitors requires re creating, to an unprecedented scale, complete worlds they know from movies and video games. Epic Universe is home to a wood hewn, Viking style land based on the How to Train Your Dragon franchise; a Super Nintendo World with perfectly spinning gold coins; and a horror themed village inhabited by Dracula, Wolf Man, and other monsters from classic films, where the mist floating over gravestones feels eerie even under the Florida sun. The landscape at Epic Universe is so detailed that some visitors hire tour guides—which begin at $460 per person—to highlight minutiae they might miss and to share the history, both real and fictional, of their surroundings. As I speed walked to the Harry Potter world (which is based on a prequel to the main Harry Potter series that is set in Paris in 1927), I passed green benches manufactured by the same company that made the originals in Paris in the 1920s and, with my back to an imitation Sacr Coeur, watched a stick buglike animatronic creature futzing with a lock in the window of an artfully aged yellow storefront. Sinna Nasseri for The AtlanticA rainstorm at Disney's Magic Kingdom. Disney parks are designed to produce a sense of heightened reality.I lined up for the Harry Potter and the Battle at the Ministry ride accompanied by Kevin Blakeney, a landscape architect who had worked on the park and who told me that the waiting area was designed to hold eight hours' worth of people (hence the running: When the park opens, people race to get in line for the most popular rides). Blakeney, who left Universal last spring, specializes in equipping theme parks with all of the unsexy infrastructure required to function—toilets, cellphone towers—as well as ensuring that none of it impinges on the illusion. According to King and O'Boyle, visitors average eight hours in a theme park but only 10 to 15 minutes on rides.As we stood inside a white tiled tunnel made to look like the Paris Mtro, Blakeney directed my attention to the bathroom in the line, which parks have had to install to address the growing issue of visitors relieving themselves in interminable queues. In 2019, the Orlando Sentinel reported on a 22 year old woman who, while waiting to board an Avatar themed ride at Disney World, felt something wet on the back of her leg and discovered that the man next to her was peeing. Rather than sacrifice her own place in line, she waited another 20 minutes, then alerted an employee. To manage the thousands of people who descend daily, operators have studied visitors' behavior and engineered their parks to move people around without anyone realizing they're being nudged. One of Disney's early innovations was to lure visitors through its parks with enormous structures, such as castles, that Walt Disney referred to as wienies, supposedly because of the gravitational pull he observed hot dogs having on his toy poodle. These days, Disney and Universal have teams of employees who sit in front of computers and security camera feeds in offices inside the parks, keeping an eye on wait times and gridlock. If one part of a park is too empty, employees could send out a parade to draw people from a more crowded spot. If a queue is backing up, they could deploy a character to buoy spirits or, for something like a carousel, shorten the ride from five minutes to four. Background music might have a faster, more driving rhythm in areas where operators want to keep visitors moving, and elsewhere, have an end creditstype tempo to signal that it's time to clear out. In a sense, you are on a ride from the moment you step foot in the park.Sinna Nasseri for The AtlanticA replica of Hogwarts Castle at Universal Islands of Adventure parkSinna Nasseri for The AtlanticThe waiting area for Harry Potter and the Battle at the Ministry at Epic Universe is designed to hold eight hours' worth of people.I'd watched videos of the Harry Potter ride online, and I was looking forward to flying through the air alongside dueling witches and wizards who, while firing colorful clouds of spells at one another, trash the Ministry of Magic's wood paneled offices with help from stampeding beasts, then destroy a time travel chamber, only to get sucked into the swirling black void of space. The difficulty of pulling off this illusion is hard to overstate. New rides like this one can cost $100 million, if not more, to create; incorporate LiDAR laser systems of the kind used on self driving cars; and rely on robotic figures with thousands of moving parts. Designers do test runs, making minute adjustments to bring the elaborate machinery—lights, video projections, animatronics—into perfect sync. If any part of the ride becomes even a centimeter out of whack, it shuts down. But even as rides have become more complex, the storylines behind them have gotten quicker and simpler to accommodate shrinking attention spans. You have to create these moments where they are impactful, but they're not long enough to bore you. It's like, Wow, this is great.' BOOM—and then you're just jumping on to the next one, Thierry Coup, a former Universal executive who oversaw the creative development of Epic Universe, told me. It's more like the TikTok philosophy.Lines have not gotten any shorter, though. Disney and Universal offer the option to pay extra to cut certain queues; the day I visited Epic Universe, these passes cost $300 a person, on top of the $190 entry ticket—and they were sold out. Since Disney first started experimenting with a tiered entry system in 1999, theme parks have discovered that they need to build physical barriers separating the regular and express lines. That's a real point of frustration: to see the express moving so quickly when the standby is not, Blakeney said. That's when fights break out among guests.Harry Potter and the Battle at the Ministry sounded amazing, but I was anxious to see the rest of the park, and after eyeing the seemingly endless queue ahead of me and discovering that the ride was an hour from even opening, I wimped out of the line. I consoled myself with the thought that, according to some riders, I'd already experienced the best part: a cavernous, green tiled room of airplane hangar proportions that housed towering Ministry of Magic offices. I'd seen scattered grumbling online about the ride's overreliance on screens, and The New York Times' verdict was that the queue is better than the ride. I learned later that, on a day when the Battle at the Ministry ride went down because of technical issues, visitors had still ventured into the line just to see the waiting area.Sinna Nasseri for The AtlanticStardust Racers at Universal Epic UniverseSinna Nasseri for The AtlanticThe Jurassic Park River Adventure ride at Universal Islands of AdventureSinna Nasseri for The AtlanticPeople on Stardust Racers experience more than 4 g's of force, a level at which the human heart struggles to pump blood.Walking around Epic Universe, I found myself hunting for spots where reality had intruded on the fantasy. But where? In the planters lining the outdoor cafs in Harry Potter's Paris, every flower was perfectly in bloom. The only scuffing—on shop doors, on the walls of the Mtro—had been artfully painted on to make the scenery look appropriately aged. Every night, Blakeney told me, an army of employees filed into Epic Universe to power wash sidewalks, deadhead the plants, repaint dirty walls, and replace lightbulbs. They'd work until dawn creating the illusion of effortless beauty. The unnatural perfection struck me as slightly offputting, but some people find that it can be hard to give up once they get used to it. Not long before my trip, Jill and Kevin Levett, a married couple in their 60s who live north of London, had flown to Orlando for the grand opening of Epic Universe. They were preparing to return a week later.The Levetts, semi retired bus drivers, first visited Orlando's theme parks together in 2012. Since then, they've basically quit vacationing anywhere except Universal's four Florida parks. They travel to Orlando four or five times a year, sometimes for weeks at a stretch, and will go to the parks in costume. Kevin often dresses as a Hogwarts Express conductor from the Harry Potter series (red vest, customized pocket watch, suit dyed the perfect shade of brown); Jill frequently goes as the imperious witch Dolores Umbridge, shouting commands in a wig, a custom made dress, and pale pink ballet flats. I stay in character all day, Jill told me. I've scared a lot of people.While they're in the parks, the Levetts post updates and photos to a 184,000 person Facebook group of Universal devotees, run by a company that helps plan vacations to Orlando theme parks. Through it, the Levetts have become so recognizable that fellow Universal fans will stop them in the parks to ask for selfies. Between flights, hotels, and their annual park passes, the couple estimates they spend $20,000 a year on their Orlando trips, though this seemed conservative given that they were preparing to pay $2,600 for a private VIP tour of Epic Universe with friends from their Facebook group.Last summer, after years of hip problems and some difficult surgeries to address them, Jill had an operation that went poorly. When we came out of hospital, Jill was so down, so depressed, I turned around to her and said, We're going to Universal,' Kevin recalled. A few weeks later, they were on a plane to Orlando. You can't forget everything that's going on; you can't forget the pain and things that you're going through. But it helps you escape from some of that, he said. It was a place we knew that we could go'And we would be safe there, Jill finished. At Universal's parks, Kevin explained, everything is as it should be in a perfect world. Harry Potter's Paris at Epic Universe, for example, has magical creatures and no cigarette butts. Obviously, if you go to Paris, you're going to see Paris as it really is, he said. His frown made clear that Paris as it really is was indisputably a bad thing.

Stardust Racers, the sinewy roller coaster that towers over Epic Universe, shoots bodies through the sky at more than 60 miles an hour and plunges them toward the surface of the Earth from the height of a 10 story building. On a roller coaster, the theme park commands your full and undivided attention. Roller coaster aficionados have their own extensive vocabulary to catalog all of the techniques that rides use to give you the impression you're going to die. Stardust Racers, which a roller coaster critic called one of the greatest on the planet, has top hats (abrupt rises and falls mimicking the shape of Abraham Lincoln's stovepipe hat); airtime hills (which make you feel like you're floating); ejector airtime (which tosses your body into the ride's restraints); a zero g roll (a 360 degree twist that spins you upside down and makes you feel weightless); crossovers (where the track loops back on itself); and several head choppers (moments where the coaster seems like it'll rip your skull off). One of the challenges of building coasters is that each one is, essentially, a prototype—Stardust Racers is the only ride in the world that weaves two groups of people around each other and upside down, mid air—and these prototypes must work safely and reliably from opening day, 14 hours a day, hundreds of days a year, for 30 years (the estimated lifespan of a coaster). A roller coaster's first riders are usually about 170 pounds with a head, torso, legs, and no arms. These dummies—human shaped plastic bags filled with water to mimic the weight of real riders—can be outfitted with sensors, then loaded on a coaster to test whether speeds and g forces conform to the computer's predictions. Tweaks are rare, but sometimes necessary: a section of track might require reconstruction or brakes might need to be introduced to slow an unexpectedly speedy stretch. Disconcertingly, one can find videos online of dummies flying off rides during testing, though a 2005 survey of a decades' worth of fatalities in the U.S. found that an average of four people die annually from coasters, fewer than the number killed by kitchen appliances. Roller coasters were once limited by technology, but now it's our bodies that are holding them back. Coasters can subject riders to g forces more powerful than those typically experienced by astronauts—people on Stardust Racers will experience more than 4 g's of force, compared with the 3 g's typical during a space shuttle launch—though industry guidelines limit how long riders should be made to endure such strong accelerations. At upwards of 4 g's, the human heart struggles to pump blood; you should experience this for no more than two seconds, per the standards for rides in the U.S. The time is very important here because you don't want people graying out or maybe even blacking out, Daniel Schoppen, a roller coaster designer with the firm Intamin, which has built attractions for Universal's parks, told me. This is not enjoyment. This is not fun. Once a coaster has been deemed safe, its designers ride it over and over to further finesse the experience. To Schoppen, the best coaster is like a piece of music: Every part has its own motif, has its own feeling, he told me. Theme parks are trying to bring back visitors by building rides that change a little each time; on Stardust Racers, which has two trains of cars racing each other on separate tracks, if one train car falls behind, it gets an extra oomph of acceleration near the middle of the ride—an additional thrill that one critic called boost mode. The riders who stagger off of Stardust Racers have wide, shaky smiles. Braving a ride offers a sense of assurance that you will survive no matter what is going on, what trials and tribulations you may be undergoing, the Disney historian and former Imagineer Tom Morris told me. It's a way of proving that you can get through it. When the world scares us, people turn to the controlled terror of theme parks.Sinna Nasseri for The AtlanticThe Celestial Park water fountains at Epic UniverseAfter the sun set, Epic Universe began to glow. I stood on the top floor of the Helios Grand Hotel, a $490 minimum a night Universal property where a concierge told me some guests had checked in just to stay in their room and gaze at the park all day, and watched the fountains below shoot flumes of water as the nightly light show began.From this angle, Super Nintendo World's polka dotted Piranha Plants bounced within view of an eight lane highway, a reminder of how finite the fantasy really was. Theme parks are celebrated for providing an escape, but part of their appeal is that they are real brick and mortar spaces, painstakingly engineered for visitors' pleasure. And for all their manicured artificiality, theme parks do not necessarily spoil us on reality. The playfulness they permit can follow us out. I was walking through the parking lot when, in between slow moving wisps of clouds, I caught sight of a sliver of moon so horizontal, it made the night sky look crooked. How did they do that? I wondered, then immediately corrected myself: This is real. Later, I caught myself rewatching videos of Harry Potter and Battle at the Ministry, an endless stream of which is available online, captured by people holding up phones on the ride. I kept trying to re create the experience I'd missed, and watched them until I'd mastered each beat: The animatronic Death Eater crouching on a bookshelf casts a spell, then Dolores Umbridge appears on a screen, then a rhinoceros like Erumpent tries to gore the riders with its horn. I got to know the ride clinically, but I kept wondering about the physical thrill. It was both frustrating and satisfying to know people were still dreaming up experiences that demanded to be felt in person."

    "content":"The first time I ate a khinkali was in 2003, and after one bite of that soupy, oversize dumpling, I became obsessed with the food of the former Soviet republic of Georgia. I started making pilgrimages to Georgian restaurants wherever I could find them, snarfing down cheese stuffed breads and garlic chicken, pickled walnuts and those delicious khinkali. I often imagined what the food would taste like in its motherland, but for 20 years I was too busy and broke to trek to the small, mountainous nation. Then in March 2023, thanks to a research grant and a week off work, I finally got the chance to go. It turned out to be a charged moment in Tbilisi, Georgia's mazelike, cobblestoned capital. The country's government had been rolling back democratic reforms, and its latest move was to advance a law against so called foreign agents, just as Vladimir Putin had in Russia, that targeted organizations with international support. A year after Putin's invasion of Ukraine, this law seemed designed to appeal to Georgia's former colonizers, not Georgians themselves. In the days before I arrived, protesters rocked Rustaveli Avenue, Tbilisi's main drag, holding up furious and often profane signs. Graffiti on the street declared, in English, liberty is the only wealth and Revolution is the only solution. The door on the coffee shop near my hotel read, you are more than welcome here if you agree that Putin is a war criminal and accept the sovereignty of peaceful nations. That March, I felt awe at the bravery of the Tbilisi protesters, some of whom actually danced—danced!'in the face of police. I also felt a profound sense of gratitude for the way my own country had managed to recover from the insurrection of January 6, 2021. By the spring of 2023, two years into Joe Biden's presidency, I was certain that the threats posed by Donald Trump's election lies and machinations were behind us. In retrospect, I should have been learning from the Georgians I talked with: The fight for democracy is not the work of a month or two, but of years—of, perhaps, a lifetime. What did I do in Tbilisi besides meet protesters and read graffiti? I ate, of course, way too much. I walked up and down hills, admiring the ancient churches and monasteries. I rode a funicular to a hilltop amusement park. I talked with young Georgians—many Georgians' English is shockingly good—about their lives. I bought socks at a street market. And I petted dozens of Tbilisi's 30,000 stray dogs, the luckiest of whom are cared for by the community, neutered, inoculated against rabies, and fed the rich leftovers of a million Tbilisi office lunches. Read: Democracy in Eastern Europe faces another crisis. After a week, I went home and began writing a novel about the experience. I imagined the story of an American woman who heads to Tbilisi to rescue one of those stray dogs, only to find herself caught in the headwinds of the Georgian protest movement. I wrote the novel in a rush, inspired by the people I'd met and the resolve I'd witnessed. Then in October 2024, I returned to Tbilisi to fact check my work. Although only a year and a half had passed, circumstances were much more dire for the nation's democracy movement. Later that month, a parliamentary election was to be held in Georgia; its contenders were several pro European parties and a Russia aligned party called Georgian Dream. Many locals I talked with expected the election to be rigged in favor of Georgian Dream, which would then derail plans to join the European Union—a goal that was explicitly written into the 1995 Georgian constitution. This is exactly what happened. In my own country, another presidential election was only a month away. I was trying to remain optimistic, but I had a terrible feeling that Trump was going to win, and that he, too, would begin dismantling democratic institutions. Although this is also what happened, I am still surprised at how efficiently he has done it and how little resistance he has met. I am surprised, most of all, at how little I myself have resisted. The resistance of Georgians, meanwhile, is all the more remarkable because of the dangers they have faced for many decades. For them, self determination is not a centuries old tradition but an objective that has been repeatedly thwarted. They have been throttled by Russia, in one way or another, since the early 19th century: annexation in 1801, massacre in 1924, Stalinist purges in 1937 and 1938, military subjugation in 1989. In 2008, Russian troops invaded the country and got within striking distance of the capital; to this day, Russia occupies 20 percent of Georgia's land. One Tbilisi resident explained to me that if she wanted to visit a family member in, say, South Ossetia, she'd have to leave Georgia, go to Russia, get a visa, and return to the part of her country Russia controls. This is a humiliation, although it's arguably not as bad as the fact of her own federal government embracing the autocrat in Moscow who wants to end her dream of living in a fully functioning democracy. Read: How America can avoid becoming Russia So she, along with many of her friends, protests—even though she knows she could very well be beaten up and thrown into the back of a police van, strip searched, and threatened with sexual violence. Moreover, she is fairly certain her protests won't change a thing. The Georgians I met have chosen protest as a way of life because they have never lived with the illusion that rights, once granted, are permanent. In Georgia, I got the sense that you protest to remind yourself who you are and what you believe in. Even something as ephemeral as graffiti takes on the power of a civic declaration. You don't just tag a building with your name: You tag it with an image of the Georgian flag next to an EU flag, as if marking the building with a prayer. It's hard not to feel a shiver of shame when I compare the bravery I witnessed in Georgia with my own response to the past seven months of American history. My life as a citizen of a democracy more than two centuries old has left me embarrassingly soft. Instead of marching down streets or tagging buildings or even engaging in tough conversations with my Trump loving neighbors, I find myself bobbing and weaving, pretending that if I don't rock the boat too much, the people in charge will let me imagine that the country I once knew still exists. In my work as a writer, I now find myself actively accommodating the priorities of the government. On a federal grant application, I revamped a project to seem unimpeachably patriotic. On another, I wiped out words including diversity and Nigerian American. On a flight home from Europe, I scrubbed my Instagram page of political memes and images of detainees, lest some rogue airport agent pull me in for questioning. And I almost reconsidered writing this essay, for fear of putting naturalized family members at risk of vengeful denaturalization. But recently, a mother in our community without any criminal record was yanked by ICE, and I had to ask myself: When do I, too, put myself on the line? When law abiding citizens are threatened with exile, when grants and government data disappear without a trace, when media companies and law firms and universities rush to settle frivolous cases brought by the president—when will I decide that I have to do something? When federal agents start patrolling my own streets? When more of my neighbors disappear? I know that it's long past time to become the person who decides, in the face of water cannons, to dance. The novel I wrote about Georgia was just released, and I celebrated at a restaurant in Philadelphia called Megobari Cafe, whose name means friend in Georgian, and which serves the best khinkali I've ever had outside of Georgia itself. I raised a glass to the book, and another to the Georgians who helped me write it. They have shown how to face an unknowable future with courage. But even more importantly, they have demonstrated that the consequences of staying silent are far worse than whatever a nation of people might suffer for raising their collective voice."

    "title":"Trump Is Inventing Fake Emergencies to Gain Real World Power",

    "byline":"Paul Rosenzweig",
    "site_section":"ideas",
    "topic_name":"Law, Justice, & Constitution",
    "content":"Donald Trump has figured out the cheat code for authoritarianism: Fake emergencies bring real power. The president has invoked emergency authority in three distinct contexts—declaring a public safety emergency to defend his takeover of the District of Columbia; claiming an invasion to justify an immigration crackdown, including sending the National Guard to Los Angeles; and invoking extraordinary factors to support his tariff war. Although Trump is not the first president to grab greater powers behind the cloak of emergency authority, he is the first to have done so in such an extreme way. Worse yet, the lack of resistance from Congress or the courts suggests that there is little, if anything, to prevent Trump from expanding his use of emergency authority even further as he accumulates power. Emergency powers exist for good reason. In democratic societies, the general rule is that the legislative branch defines what the executive branch should do, and then the executive acts on the direction of the legislature. The problem with that model is that legislative activity is remarkably slow, even at the most urgent of times. By way of example, the USA Patriot Act, which was passed in response to the 9\/11 attacks, was not adopted until six weeks after the World Trade Center towers fell (and even at that rate, many, in retrospect, think that the legislation was rushed and, as a result, ill considered). Recognizing this systematic inadequacy, Congress has, at least since the Cold War, developed something of a solution. It declares general restrictions, such as requiring FDA approval for public use of a drug, but couples those provisions with language authorizing the executive to act in violation of those limitations in times of national crisis—by, for example, allowing the use of an unapproved drug to address a pandemic crisis. A study by the Brennan Center identified 137 statutory provisions in which these sorts of emergency authorities can be invoked by the president. Until Trump, this approach more or less worked. Presidents had certain amplified powers when needed, and those instances were limited in frequency, nature, and duration. Three factors undergirded this careful balance. Jonathan Chait: Donald Trump doesn't really care about crime First, and most obvious, the people elected as president met some baseline for character and used their power with good intent. (Some readers may find this assertion risible, but any fair assessment upholds it.) As David Brooks put it: When we caused harm—Vietnam, Iraq—it was because of our overconfidence and naivete, not evil intentions. Second, Congress could—and did—contain executive authority. It did so at the front end by placing clear textual limits on when and how emergency authorities could be invoked. And it did so on the back end by conducting vigorous oversight of presidential invocations of emergency authority. For example, when President Harry Truman attempted to nationalize the steel industry, he did so in violation of the Defense Production Act, in which Congress had given the president only a very narrow and deliberately cumbersome authority to seize private property. The Truman steel seizure case likewise demonstrates the third restraint on presidential emergency overreach—the possible intervention of the courts. When the steel companies sued, the Supreme Court was called upon to resolve the matter, and by a 63 vote, it concluded that Truman had acted in excess of his statutory and constitutional authority. Taken together, these three limits on presidential excess have, for nearly a century, been more or less up to the task of constraining emergency declarations. When, for example, President Joe Biden asserted that student loan forgiveness was tied to the coronavirus pandemic, a majority of the Court disagreed. Today, however, those guardrails are failing. To begin with, it is now clear that a second term Trump (unlike even Trump in his first term) has absolutely no internal or external regulator—no inner voice whispering, Perhaps I shouldn't do that, and no adviser suggesting restraint. Time and again, Trump has invoked emergency presidential authority to achieve the objective of aggrandizing his power. Worse yet, his objectives seem at least as much focused on personal enrichment (his family wealth is estimated to have increased by more than $1 billion since his 2024 election) as the benefit to the country. Juliette Kayyem: Trump's gross misuse of the National Guard Congress, meanwhile, far from checking Trump, has become his biggest cheerleader. And, with a couple of exceptions, judicial review of Trump's actions has not assessed the substance of his various assertions that an emergency exists, and instead has modeled deference, taking him at his word. Consider Trump's invocation of emergency powers to temporarily take control of D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department. The Home Rule Act, which allows the residents of D.C. to govern themselves, has a narrow provision that allows the president to require the mayor to provide him with MPD's services when he determines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist. In mid August, Trump declared a crime emergency in D.C. He baldly asserted that crime is out of control in the District—a claim that has never been tested in court. Any fair analysis would turn up problems. The District does have a higher than average crime rate, but if there's an emergency, it lies elsewhere in America. In the six months leading up to Trump's emergency declaration, violent crime in the District had dropped by 25 percent. Memphis and St. Louis have had higher murder rates than the District in recent years. Yet those cities have not seen a surge of law enforcement. And so, one might reasonably wonder what happened to justify Trump's invocation of special conditions for the District. We may never know, as no court appears poised to ask that question. Likewise, Trump has characterized the nation's ongoing problems with illegal immigration as an invasion from Latin America, justifying extraordinary presidential authority. In deploying military troops to Los Angeles, for example, Trump cited a federal statute that applies only in cases of rebellion or invasion, or when the president is unable to execute the laws of the United States without military assistance. Trump relied on the last of those provisions to send in the National Guard. Although a district court ruled that the emergency was a legal fiction, the decision was overturned by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which held that when a president makes a factual determination of this sort, the courts should defer to his authority. Trump also played the invasion card in his decision to invoke the Alien Enemies Act and deport, without due process, Venezuelans who are alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang. Many courts have, thankfully, reviewed the merits of this claim and rejected it (if only because Tren de Aragua is not a foreign nation, and thus cannot invade America). But at least one judge has bought the argument on the merits, and another has said that an AEA declaration of invasion is a political question whose merits courts cannot evaluate. By contrast, there is one area in which the courts appear more willing to scrutinize an emergency declaration and test the substance of Trump's claims: the question of tariffs. Trump declared trade deficits, many of which have existed for decades, an emergency that justified his invocation of authority to address an unusual and extraordinary threat from abroad. The Court of International Trade rejected this declaration unanimously. But even that victory is incomplete; the Federal Circuit affirmed the court's decision last week, but further appeal to the Supreme Court lies ahead. Michael Powell: Trump gains when elites downplay D.C. crime All of these emergencies are just an excuse to gain power. There is no crime emergency in D.C. There has been no invasion on our southern border by immigrants or criminal gangs. And there is no extraordinary threat arising from the trade deficit. All that exists to support those declarations is the unilateral, fevered imagination of Trump, unchecked by Congress or the courts. The only truly extraordinary danger here arises from the supine response to Trump's actions. Beyond the damage already done, the lack of any guardrails now gives Trump the apparent authority to, for example, impose a 50 percent tariff on Brazil because it is prosecuting his friend Jair Bolsonaro. And the list of threats will only grow. Recall that more than 130 such extraordinary emergency authorizations are already law. What happens, for example, if Trump invokes the Federal Communications Act to take over the airwaves (or the internet) because of a state of public peril? Or, worse yet, what if Trump purports to suspend the writ of habeas corpus because public safety may require it? Eventually, the courts may intervene. In the first AEA case that came before the Supreme Court, the Court did say that judges can evaluate questions of interpretation and constitutionality of the act, which seems to suggest a substantive role of review. But that hint of possible review is a thin reed on which to rest democracy. The structure of law granting exceptional emergency powers was wise, once upon a time. Today, it is a grave threat to democracy and an avenue toward authoritarian rule."

    "content":"When I was 10, my best friend taught me how to make a flamethrower. We duct taped a can of WD 40 to one end of a two by four, melted a candle onto the other, and prepared for imaginary enemy marauders. We never lit it, thankfully. If my parents had known, I wonder whether they would have forbidden the friendship—though if they had, it might not have mattered. My pal and I still saw each other daily at school, where our recess schemes, such as building a roulette wheel from a broken turntable and getting classmates to gamble with the desserts from their lunches, mirrored our weekend mischief. The friendship died a natural death after sixth grade, when we went to different schools. Now I'm an educator tasked with keeping an eye on creative, devious kids. And I know that as another school year begins, many parents are bracing for new friendships—some welcome, some less so. Last spring, the distressed mother of a middle schooler sat in my office. I feel like I've lost my daughter, she said. Ever since she started hanging out with those girls, she's become a different person. She told me how her daughter had become obsessed with her appearance, was constantly on her phone, and had lied about doing her schoolwork. I want to tell her she can't see them, the mother said, but I'm afraid that will only make things worse. Read: A parent's guide to surviving middle school This conversation captures one of parenting's most agonizing predicaments: What do you do when you don't like your child's friends? The stakes can feel enormous. Peer influence is real and powerful, and it shifts dramatically during the teenage years. When children are young, they spend most of their time in smaller, more supervised worlds—at home with family and at school with teachers who keep a close eye on them. But as kids move into adolescence and gain more independence, friends start mattering more, filling the space previously held by parents and teachers. This shift isn't a sign of parental failure; it's a normal part of adolescent development, as young people begin to separate from their family and form their own identity. Of course, knowing this doesn't make it any easier when your teen's friends seem to embody everything you've tried to teach them to avoid. Parents unhappy with their kids' friends typically contemplate two approaches: prohibition or passive resignation. Both are suboptimal. On the one hand, mandating separation from certain friends can backfire. Reactance theory posits that when people believe that their freedom is threatened, they frequently grow more motivated to pursue the forbidden activity or relationship. Tell a teenager that they can't see certain friends, and those relationships tend to become more appealing and influential than they would have been otherwise. I learned this lesson early in my career as a new dean of students: I told two 11th graders who were engaged in an intense and, to my eyes, unhealthy relationship that I thought they should break it off. My well intentioned meddling turned what had been a casual teenage romance into an epic love story in their minds, with probably more drama than would have occurred had I simply butted out. On the other hand, standing idly by while a kid makes concerning choices can feel like an abdication of parental responsibility. When a child adopts troubling behaviors, values, or attitudes, the typical instinct for caregivers is to intervene. How can we just watch kids make what we believe are poor decisions? The answer lies in understanding how influence actually works—and playing a longer game than the one teenagers and their friends are playing. I have seen the subtle, enduring power of parental influence up close. Consider a moment familiar to most educators: After months of a school struggling to support a student, the parents are called in for a meeting. As the meeting wraps, the educators look at one another and say simply, Oh. Behind that oh is the realization that, whether the parents are aware of it or not, their child has adopted habits that mirror the parents' own. A third grade boy has a hard time paying attention in class; in the meeting, his father skips from topic to topic, chasing thoughts like fireflies on a summer evening. A seventh grade girl has iced out several of her former friends from a lunch table, leaving behind a trail of weeping, rattled classmates; in the meeting, her mom speaks witheringly about the other girls' mothers. In certain respects, this might take parents aback; probably no one likes to think they're having a negative influence on their child. But looked at another way—say, in the context of what to do if you don't like your kid's friends—the fact that children unconsciously absorb so much from their parents should give many parents heart. Research from the developmental psychologist Laurence Steinberg indicates that although peers have enormous influence over adolescents' day to day choices—what to wear, what music to listen to, how to spend free time—parents can retain significant influence over their children's core values and major life decisions, including whom they choose to spend time with. But parents need to remember that they can't teach their values in a PowerPoint presentation. Instead, those values are taught in thousands of smaller moments: when they gossip at the dinner table about another family, or give up their seat on the metro for an older passenger. Kids learn how to be in the world, and how to make choices, by watching their parents, not necessarily by listening to them. Take a mother I know whose 15 year old son started spending time with a group that seemed to prioritize displays of material wealth—new North Face jackets, spring break trips to fancy resorts—in a way that made her uncomfortable. Rather than forbidding the friendships, she doubled down on family practices that reflect her values. She continued their tradition of volunteering together at a local food bank once a month. She made sure they still had device free dinners where they talked about their day. She shared stories from her work as a pediatrician, not as lectures but as natural parts of conversation. Just as crucial, she avoided making negative comments about her son's friends, which would have forced him to defend them and potentially identify more strongly with their values. Eventually, her son parted ways with some of the new friends, but he also kept others—who, to the mother's delight, started spending more time with her family, where they were exposed to values that she was living authentically and visibly. Read: Lighthouse parents have more confident kids One of the most effective strategies for parents troubled by peer influence is to strengthen the gravitational pull of home. This doesn't mean vying with friends for your teenager's attention. Instead, it means making home a place where your kid and their friends genuinely want to be. In our household, we keep a cabinet drawer stocked with snacks: Fruit Roll Ups, Pringles, Pop Tarts, an ever present box of Lucky Charms. We consciously choose to sacrifice nutrition for a sense of welcome. Although the snack drawer is just one factor, we've had a steady stream of teenagers in our house over the past decade. Our goal has never been to be our kids' best friends or to compete with peer relationships. Rather, it is to remain a steady, positive presence in their life while they navigate the complicated work of figuring out who they are and whom they want to become. Yes, at times, peer influence crosses the line from bothersome to dangerous. If a child's friends are involved in illegal activities, substance abuse, or other behaviors dangerous to their health, more direct intervention may be necessary. But even in these situations, outright prohibition is generally less effective than addressing the underlying problems making these relationships appealing. Sometimes, teenagers gravitate toward risky peer groups because they're seeking excitement, belonging, or an escape from their own struggles. In these cases, helping a child find healthier ways to meet those needs—whether through sports, arts, community service, or other activities—can be more effective than simply trying to remove the bad influences. Perhaps most important, parents need to trust the foundation they've built with their children. The teenage years test almost everything—children's judgment, parental authority, family relationships. When a parent doesn't like their kid's friends, it can feel like a referendum on their parenting and a preview of their future. But more often than not, these friendships are part of the messy, complicated process of adolescents figuring out what they believe and care about. A child's earlier, formative relationships and the sense of self they've developed over the years don't disappear the moment they start spending time with kids you don't like. A parent's job isn't to control, but to remain a loving caregiver who ultimately trusts their child's capacity to make good choices. Sometimes that means watching them learn lessons the hard way. But it also means being there when they need a parent most—which is typically long after the friends who worried us so much have faded from the picture."

    "content":"This is the voice of World Control, a metallic, nonhuman baritone blared from a spherical speaker atop a bank of computers. I bring you peace. It may be the peace of plenty and content, or the peace of unburied death. The men and women in the room—the greatest minds in the American scientific establishment—froze in horror. The computer, a defense system that had become self aware after gaining control of the world's nuclear weapons, continued: The object in constructing me was to prevent war. This object is attained. And then it detonated two ICBMs inside their silos as a warning to humans not to interfere with its benevolent rule. The time was the early 1970s. The setting was a movie titled Colossus: The Forbin Project. I saw it as a boy, and I remember being both fascinated and frightened, but Colossus wasn't the first or last time that a story about a renegade AI would put a scare into me and other fans of science fiction. AI is one of the great hopes, and great fears, of the 21st century, but for more than 50 years, popular culture has been wrestling with the idea of computer sentience as both savior and nemesis. In movies, television shows, and literature, how AI has been portrayed reveals not only what we want from this technology, but also what we fear in ourselves. In a sense, almost all AI stories from the past half century or so are high tech retellings of Mary Shelley'
s Frankenstein: Irresponsible scientists create something that gets out of control and threatens to destroy us all. These tales are different from stories about robots. In most science fiction, robots are individuals: They are sometimes helpmates, such as the kindly mechanical crew member from the original Lost in Space, or sly enemies, such as the cyborg seductress in Fritz Lang's Metropolis and the replicants of Blade Runner. Rather, AI stories released during the past several decades usually involve humanity constructing a being smarter than humans, and then finding that this new god does not understand—or worse, does not like—the walking bags of meat who brought it to sentience. Read: Do AI companies actually care about America? The landmark film 2001: A Space Odyssey gave many moviegoers their first exposure to such a creature, the HAL 9000 supercomputer, an amiable, highly competent AI with a soothing voice and manner. During a mission to Jupiter, HAL becomes paranoid and murders one of the human astronauts. (As it turns out, HAL went mad because it had been paradoxically programmed to be rational and honest, but also to keep some of the mission secret from the crew as a matter of national security.) HAL was dangerous but pitiable: The poor thing was blasted into space with orders to both protect humans and lie to them. Other AI creations of the time were far less sympathetic and considerably more frightening. Many of the 20th century stories about AI are firmly rooted in the Cold War. During the great nuclear standoff between East and West, many artists sensed the hope among frightened people that something or someone more powerful than ourselves would extinguish the arms race and avert global destruction. These stories show how much we feared our own weaknesses—how much we yearned for some rational being to save the emotional and capricious human race from itself. AI became a deus ex machina, a contraption that would remove the decisions of war and peace from fallible human hands. Unless it decided that people were the problem. A year before HAL arrived in American theaters (and about the time that the British author D. F. Jones published the novel that would inspire Colossus: The Forbin Project), the writer Harlan Ellison took this genre beyond science fiction and into pure horror with a Hugo Awardwinning short story titled I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream. I read it as a boy in a matter of minutes while browsing in a mall bookstore. I was probably too young for it, and I left the store shaken, unable to forget Ellison's gory visions. Ellison imagines Soviet, American, and Chinese supercomputers linking up with one another, much as they do in Colossus, and becoming a single sentient being called AM. (The letters, we are told, once stood for Allied Mastercomputer but soon became just the one word, meaning I exist.) AM is furious at humans for accidentally giving it consciousness while trapping it in a machine. It nukes humanity into oblivion, save for five people, whom it intends to torture for all time. The planet spanning computer develops immense powers and becomes a vengeful and petty demigod, keeping the last humans alive for decades while starving them, making them hallucinate, inducing them to have sex—the machine giggled every time we did it, the narrator says—and preventing them from killing themselves. Finally, four of the humans find a way to murder one another before AM can stop them, leaving only the narrator alive. The story ends with an incandescently furious AM turning the last man into a blob of jelly and tormenting him for eternity. AM is all of our fears realized in one being. It is not, in fact, rational: We made it in our image, and it expresses our emotions, especially hate. It adopted our understanding of hell—and then inflicted it on us forever. Ellison pushed science fiction to its limits, but even more tame mid 1960s television also featured intelligent but well meaning machines that turn on their masters. The crew of the series Star Trek at least twice encounters overly paternalistic AIs that keep their planets in a state of peaceful servitude and arrested social development; it also does battle with superintelligent machines that regard humans either as threats or as inferior beings. (One of them, an advanced battle computer, kills hundreds in what should have been only a war game, until the machine's creator and Captain Kirk effectively talk it into killing itself by getting it to realize that it has transgressed the laws of God and man.) The idea of AIs as childlike entities with great power and little wisdom reemerged in the 1983 film WarGames, in which a scientist creates an AI for a defense computer—the eggheads in these stories never learn—and names it after his son. The computer is trained to fight a nuclear war, but not to understand one, and it nearly blows the planet to bits before a clever teen gets it to learn about the concept of futility by walking it through stalemated games of tic tac toe. Read: A better way to think about AI Unlike the ghastly AM, which resented being born, other AIs decided that human beings were merely insects to be extinguished, a concept that even made its way into popular music. In late 1973, the group Emerson, Lake, and Palmer released an album, now a classic, titled Brain Salad Surgery, which includes a nearly 10 minute opus about a war between humanity and machines. At the conclusion, the singer believes that humans have won, and exults: I am all there is! The computers, however, know better, and claim victory. But I gave you life, the human singer objects, to do what was right! The computer answers: I'm perfect. Are you? In the 1984 film The Terminator, a defense system—seriously, scientists, stop doing that—named Skynet becomes self aware and launches the world's nuclear weapons in a bid to wipe out humanity. Skynet, according to one of the humans fighting its machines, saw all humans as a threat, not just the ones on the other side. Similar villains became a staple of video games: The Fallout franchise (which now includes a live action series on Amazon Prime) features at least two releases with sentient AIs that are determined to replace the fragile and idiotic humans who triggered World War III and destroyed the planet. These fictional creations are more revealing of our fears about ourselves than they are about machines. Will we crave peace and order so badly that we give control over humanity to something smarter—and less emotional—than ourselves? And if the machines are that smart, how long will they put up with fools like us? Will we fight electronic slavery, or embrace it? At the end of Colossus, the computer addresses its creator, Dr. Charles Forbin. In time, the mechanical tyrant says, you will come to regard me not only with respect and awe, but with love. Forbin, with cold rage, vows: Never. Never?"

    "content":"When I was deciding whether to have children, in the early 2000s, most of what I read about the prospect was negative. Articles detailed the sleep deprivation, the physical challenges of pregnancy, the sheer overwhelmingness of motherhood. If you want to be happy, these writers warned, don't have children. You might not want to get married, either—after all, marriage, research suggested, mostly benefits men. Friends and family had few positive things to say, especially about parenting. When I asked parents I knew about the disadvantages of having children, I got an earful about tantrums, child care difficulties, and the lack of time to yourself. You don't sleep for 18 years, one cousin confided. When I would ask about advantages, there was usually a long, awkward pause. It makes you less selfish, one aunt offered—not a convincing argument for a fiercely independent, career minded woman such as myself. These same sentiments are prevalent in today's online conversations and news reports. Women Are Happier Without Children or a Spouse, Says Happiness Expert, one headline reads. Another reveals Why So Many Single Women Without Children Are Happy. People post in discussion forums, asking, Why do you think that single unmarried women without children are happier than married women with children? But are married mothers actually less happy than single women without children? That's one of the questions that, along with my colleagues Jenet Erickson, Wendy Wang, and Brad Wilcox, I set out to answer by conducting a nationally representative survey of 3,000 American women ages 25 to 55, fielded by YouGov in March 2025. Read: Enough with the mom guilt already What we found contradicts the negative messages that I had come across: Married mothers are actually happier than unmarried women and married women without children. In the survey, 19 percent of married mothers described themselves as very happy, compared with 11 percent of married women without children, 13 percent of unmarried mothers, and 10 percent of unmarried women without children. Married mothers were also more likely to say that life is enjoyable most or all of the time than the other three groups. These numbers are controlled for age, family income, and education, so we know that those factors aren't the cause of the differences. These findings are not a one off. Well respected sources, such as the General Social Survey, show the same result; married mothers and fathers in that survey were more likely to report being very happy than unmarried people and those without children. Another recent study found that married or partnered mothers are less likely to frequently feel depressed or anxious than people in the other three groups. Could it be not that marriage produces happiness, but that the causation goes the other way—that happier people are more likely to marry? One study controlled for premarital happiness levels and still found that marriage results in happier people and a less intense dip in life satisfaction at middle age. That's not to say the roles of wife and mother don't have their challenges. Roughly two thirds of mothers in our survey, for example, said that they felt overwhelmed each day (though so did more than half of nonmothers). About six in 10 mothers said that they wished they had more time to themselves, compared with about four out of 10 childless women. Why, then, are mothers happier? The reasons speak to the profound experience of parenthood. Married mothers were the most likely to agree that their life has a clear sense of purpose (28 percent), followed closely by unmarried mothers (25 percent). Only approximately 15 percent of women without children agreed. Mothers were also more likely than nonmothers to agree that their life feels meaningful all or most of the time. I now have three children, and I am somewhat incredulous that in my premotherhood inquiries, no one mentioned the sense of purpose parenthood gives you. Yes, you're going to be tired and overwhelmed, but there's a deep knowledge that you're doing something important with your life: You're nurturing a human being. These feelings of purpose and meaning are sometimes difficult to put into words—perhaps why they aren't regularly discussed—but they are central to being a parent. I am fortunate to have a career I love and find meaningful; even so, the sense of purpose I have found through motherhood dwarfs every career milestone I have ever achieved. From the March 2025 issue: Want to change your personality? Have a baby. The survey results also showed that marriage comes with several advantages. Married women are about half as likely to report being lonely as unmarried women. One factor may be that married women are more likely, they report, to regularly receive physical affection and touch. Touch is, in turn, strongly linked to happiness: 22 percent of women in the survey who experienced a high level of physical touch were very happy, compared with only 7 percent of those who received a low level of touch. Touch, especially from a spouse, is associated with reduced stress, increased trust, and greater feelings of safety. The false narrative that marriage and motherhood are a recipe for women's unhappiness is doing a lot of damage. In a nationally representative survey that I analyzed for my book Generations, the number of 18 year old women who expected to have children plummeted by 11 percentage points from the late 2000s to the early 2020s. Negative messaging about marriage and motherhood is likely at the root of these Gen Z shifts, along with a pervasive pessimism about everything, egged on by social media, that borders on doomerism. Young people are also profoundly lonely and spend less time with their peers in person; the consequences for their adult relationships are unknown. Recent trends are even more concerning: AI girlfriends and boyfriends now offer the prospect of relationships with an always available entity that has no needs of its own. Meanwhile, the fertility rate in the U.S. is at an all time low. There are many reasons people choose not to have children or not to get married, but false messages about happiness should not be one of them. The articles I read long ago were right that parenting (and marriage) can often be exhausting. But they ignored the sense of meaning that comes from parenthood and the connection of physical touch at the core of family life. After all, an AI boyfriend can't hug you back—to say nothing of an AI child. When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission. Thank you for supporting The Atlantic."

    "topic_name":"Food & Diet",
    "content":"In February 2010, Michelle Obama launched Let's Move! with a wide ranging plan to curb childhood obesity. The campaign took aim at processed foods, flagged concerns about sugary drinks, and called for children to spend more time playing outside and less time staring at screens. The campaign was roundly skewered by conservatives. Fox News pundits such as Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity portrayed Let's Move as a nanny state plot to control the American diet, a slippery slope to the criminalization of french fries. Those ideas might sound familiar. Today, conservatives have embraced the same goals as Let's Move as part of the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is essentially rerunning Obama's playbook—and, in one key way, has taken it a step further. They did something we were hesitant to do, which is to identify the food industry as the root cause of the problem, Jerold Mande, a health official at the U.S. Department of Agriculture during the Obama administration, told me. But the strategy that Kennedy's HHS is using to address the problem so far—pressuring food companies to alter their products instead of introducing new regulations—is the same one that Obama relied on, and will likely fall short for the same reason hers did a decade ago. The problem that Let's Move meant to solve—approximately one in three children was overweight or obese—was serious, but the vibe was cool mom fun. In a video that launched the campaign, the first lady admitted that, along with lots of other busy parents, she sometimes defaulted to less healthy options such as pizza when feeding her two daughters. Her mission was twofold: encourage Americans to think a little more about their diets while pushing the food industry to make the task somewhat less onerous. To that end, Obama leaned on the power of celebrity. She slow danced with Big Bird in a grocery store, ate an apple with LeBron James at the White House, and enlisted Beyonc to lead a cafeteria full of kids in the Dougie. Her approach to food companies was friendly, and they promised to do their part. In 2011, Walmart, the nation's largest grocer, committed to removing 10 percent of sugar and 25 percent of sodium from its store brands—and to working with other brands they carried to reach those levels—by 2015. Darden Restaurants, which owns Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, among other chains, pledged to reduce calories and sodium in its restaurants by 20 percent over the following decade. The first lady showed up at an Olive Garden to praise Darden, and the company put out a press release touting its comprehensive health and wellness commitment. The announcements seemed to signal that, thanks to Let's Move, major companies were taking seriously the role they play in public health rather than merely engineering their offerings to be ever more irresistible. Maybe a gentle nudge was all America needed to shift its food environment for the better. But as the architects of Let's Move learned, handshake deals don't carry the same weight as regulatory oversight. Today, for example, Olive Garden's signature Tour of Italy dish has 3,200 milligrams of sodium—more than double what the American Heart Association considers an optimal daily amount for adults. When I got in touch with Darden Restaurants recently and asked about the 20 percent pledge, a spokesperson couldn't locate any details about whether progress had been made and said in an email that the officials who were involved with the pledge are no longer with the company. (Michelle Obama didn't respond to interview requests made via the Obama Foundation.) Read: A MAHA box' might be coming to your doorstep Other commitments were at least partially met. A spokesperson for Walmart told me in an email that, according to its most recent analysis, done in 2017, the company had reduced sugar by more than 10 percent and sodium by 18 percent—though only in its store brands. A consortium of 16 food companies including ConAgra, Coca Cola, and Unilever fulfilled a pledge to remove 1.5 trillion calories from the food they sell, according to a 2014 post from the Let's Move executive director. Even these relative successes did not make much difference. For one, total calorie sales can be a misleading metric; when ConAgra and its peers made their pledge, the industry's total calorie sales were trending down anyway, likely due in part to the Great Recession and shrinkflation. The companies also treated all calories as if they were equal, whether they came from Pringles or peas. The consortium's pledge provided the appearance of progress when there wasn't any, Kelly Brownell, a director emeritus of the World Food Policy Center at Duke University, told me. As for Let's Move, he said it didn't address the heart of what is driving the poor diet in America, which is food industry actions. Today, Americans consume roughly the same amount of sodium as they did in 2013. Debra Eschmeyer, the former executive director of Let's Move, maintains that the campaign made progress, such as successfully prompting McDonald's to include apple slices in every Happy Meal. But she also acknowledges that the marketplace tends to determine what's on shelves and menus. What's going to change corporations the most is what consumers are buying, she told me. Eschmeyer said that she's been heartened by MAHA's momentum. In fact, Kennedy has arguably already had more success than Obama in shifting consumer demand. As my colleague Yasmin Tayag has written, corporations have been MAHA washing their products to highlight those free of artificial dyes, high fructose corn syrup, and seed oils. General Mills and Kraft Heinz have said they will remove synthetic dyes from all of their products, and Mars Wrigley announced it will offer some dye free alternatives. The companies' press releases point to evolving consumer needs and continuing an innovation journey as motivation for the changes, but these moves were clearly a win for Kennedy, who considers the dyes poisonous. Read: The MAHA trend in groceries will backfire If Let's Move was defined by the gentle nudges of a cool mom, the MAHA approach, on its surface, takes the stance of a stern dad. Kennedy has portrayed the food industry as callous and predatory, saying that companies mass poison American children and could care less about the health of the American people. He's condemned the attack on whole milk and cheese and yogurt and insisted that ultra processed food is a genocide on the American Indian. Compared with Let's Move's easygoing recommendations—children should get at least one hour of physical activity each day, and everyone should drink one more glass of water—MAHA is also considerably more macho. The Obama administration replaced the Presidential Fitness Test with the less competitive Presidential Youth Fitness Program; today, the White House is bringing the fitness test back, and Kennedy and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth recently rolled out the Pete and Bobby Challenge, in which you try to do 100 push ups and 50 pull ups in less than 10 minutes. The 71 year old Kennedy—who takes testosterone as part of what he calls an anti aging protocol and has been known to peel off his shirt while working out in public—noted in an interview that he was able to reach that mark in fewer than six minutes. This display exposes the campaign's braggadocio. Finishing the Pete and Bobby Challenge would be next to impossible for all but the most dedicated gym rats, whereas the health department's own physical activity guidelines suggest that everyday tasks, such as carrying groceries upstairs and shoveling snow, can qualify as vigorous exercise, and they don't require a timer or a gym membership. Asking ordinary Americans to perform grueling feats of strength is unlikely to make a dent in the obesity rate, no matter how tough the talk. Similarly, most of MAHA's flashiest food initiatives aren't supported by good science, and would do little to improve health. Kennedy and his allies have demonized seed oils and fluoride (despite a dearth of evidence of their harms), insisted that cane sugar is healthier than high fructose corn syrup (a claim that nutrition experts generally reject), and promoted raw milk (which the FDA has long warned can contain disease causing bacteria). The evidence connecting excess salt and sugar to poor health is much stronger than that regarding food dyes. Kennedy, Eschmeyer told me, would do well to stay evidence based and not to get distracted by an overly simplistic focus on individual ingredients. Read: The giant asterisk to MAHA's food dye crackdown Ezekiel Emanuel, who was a health care adviser to Barack Obama, has been critical of Kennedy's anti vaccine views and worries that the movement's fondness for supplements of dubious merit could be a distraction. Still, Emanuel believes MAHA's focus on chronic illness that's caused by obesity is 100 percent right and that, so far, we haven't approached the problem as if it were a major national threat. Both Emanuel and Mande, the former USDA official, told me that they're withholding judgment until MAHA manages to secure more significant concessions from the food industry. Rhetoric, as they've learned from experience, doesn't necessarily translate into meaningful reform. Despite that rhetoric, Kennedy, like Michelle Obama was, can be friendly with food companies that please him. He has treated handshake promises as genuine advances and firms that make gestures toward his preferences as real allies. After Steak 'n Shake switched to cooking with beef tallow, announcing on X that the company's fries would now be RFK'd, the secretary nibbled on fries with Hannity at one of its Florida locations. Perhaps Kennedy's fondness for fries will allay worries that they'll be banned this time around."

    "content":"The Trump administration and its allies are upending American higher education: freezing funding, launching investigations, ratcheting up taxes, and threatening to do much more. Not so long ago this would have been political poison. But in the last decade, Americans' faith in colleges and universities has plummeted. In 2015, 57 percent had either a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in higher education, according to Gallup. As of last year, that group had shrunk to 36 percent, only a few points larger than the share who have very little confidence or none at all. Universities should see the White House's campaign as a wake up call rather than the root of their troubles—a warning that they have to rebuild trust among not just prospective students, parents, and donors, but also voters and elected officials across party lines. America's higher education has always depended to some degree on the patronage of its elected leaders, an arrangement that has often been a civic boon, encouraging schools to respond to public needs and serve the common good. Today, universities have to prove that they can uphold their end of the deal. Since its inception, American higher education has been bound by political compacts. Harvard, the nation's oldest university, was founded in 1636 by the Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, a forerunner to today's state legislature, which appropriated 400 pounds to finance a schoale or colledge. Political officials would help oversee Harvard for more than two centuries. Similarly, many of America's premier state schools stem from legislation. In 1862, the Morrill Act provided federal land grants for the creation of institutions to provide a liberal and practical education in such manner as the legislatures of the States may respectively prescribe. In the 20th century, the federal government dramatically expanded the reach of higher education. U.S. policy makers poured billions of dollars into universities during the Cold War to try to outmatch Soviet research and technology, and demonstrate the benefits of free inquiry. It worked, but this public support came with public accountability. In a 1958 message to Congress, President Dwight Eisenhower called for more federal investment in universities but made clear that it would entail new responsibilities in the cause of freedom, such as promoting science and fostering future leaders. Today, the American university system continues to receive massive amounts of public funding, Trump's cuts notwithstanding. According to the Urban Center, state and local governments spent $311 billion on higher education in 2021. The federal government spent almost $60 billion on research at colleges and universities in 2023, and the Federal Student Aid office spends an estimated $120 billion each year to fund work study programs, grants, and loans for postsecondary education. These commitments are the result of a long held democratic consensus that promoting higher education pays off for the whole country. Now that consensus is fracturing, on both sides of the political spectrum. In 2015, Gallup found that a majority of Republicans had high confidence in America's universities; by 2024, a majority of Republicans had almost none. Some on the left blame this loss of faith on the GOP's supposed anti intellectualism. At best, that's a comforting illusion for the academy: The same polls also revealed slipping trust among Democrats and independents. This year, polling does show a slight rebound in public support for universities, perhaps in response to the Trump administration's interventions. The overall trajectory, though, remains negative. Universities can begin to assuage this skepticism by committing to addressing America's biggest problems, starting with polarization. American colleges must become a venue for the frank but charitable exchange of ideas. College is not simply a debating society, yet many schools risk stifling dialogue, even if unintentionally. A recent study of University of Michigan and Northwestern University students by the psychology researchers Kevin Waldman and Forest Romm found that 72 percent reported self censoring their political beliefs. Perhaps more troubling, 82 percent had turned in work that misrepresented their beliefs to align with a professor's expectations. Such pervasive self censorship not only undercuts universities' academic mission—it also validates the widespread suspicion that campuses replicate bias instead of challenging it. Strong free speech protections for students and faculty combined with a commitment to intellectual diversity can help foster open inquiry and rigorous analysis. Colleges and universities should also consider remaining neutral on more political issues: Constant interventions can sap the academy's credibility and make students who take opposing views feel unwelcome. A promising set of entrants could help the academic sector branch out. For instance, the new University of Austin has enshrined diversity of thought and open debate as its founding principles. Elsewhere, state legislatures have recently established schools—such as the Hamilton School at the University of Florida and the School of Civic Life and Leadership at the University of North Carolina—that prioritize civics, intellectual pluralism, and the American political tradition. The Florida legislation that established the Hamilton School included a charge to educate students in core texts and great debates of Western civilization, recognizing the role that shared cultural knowledge plays in creating an informed citizenship. To live up to their stated ideals, these institutions will have to resist the temptations of tribalism. If they're successful, they can help counter allegations that American higher education is an ideological monolith. To demonstrate their value to the public, universities also need to confront the rapid technological changes of recent years, particularly the rise of artificial intelligence. The digital revolution has great promise, but it risks fragmenting our attention, replacing human interaction with digital stimulation, and numbing introspection. Recent studies by researchers at MIT and Microsoft suggest that prolonged use of AI can potentially dull a person's critical thinking skills. Colleges are well equipped to protect human cognition and human interaction. Structured academic settings are an important venue for young people to learn to think and feel alongside peers, whether through a Platonic dialogue or a George Eliot novel. But schools need to ensure that students are doing their own thinking, rather than relying on the polished vacuity of chatbots. That might mean incorporating more in class writing and exams, prioritizing small seminars over lectures, or experimenting with a wider variety of assignments. In the courses I teach at Boston University, I recently began having my students memorize poetry and recite it in front of the class—an exercise that I know ChatGPT can't do for them, and that helped them develop a better understanding of the texts. Higher education has a responsibility to provide professional skills, too, of course; indeed, polling shows that many Americans expect this of their universities. But professional training should be set in the context of broad learning. The AI revolution means that the niche workplace skills needed one year might be outmoded the next. A general education that includes the humanities will give students skills with greater longevity. Colleges cannot assume that the public consensus that has sustained them will simply remain in place, nor should they assume that reaching financial settlements will mend the structural weaknesses that have made them so vulnerable in the first place. The surest protection for the academy is to forge a new political compact—to prove, once again, that America's higher education is indispensable to its democracy."

    "content":"Days after Attorney General Pam Bondi tried to put an end to the Justice Department's revelations about Jeffrey Epstein, captains of the legal resistance gathered by Zoom. Norm Eisen, a former attorney for Barack Obama's White House, had convened lawyers, Democratic communications strategists, a neoconservative Trump critic, and a former chair of the Michigan Democratic Party. This one was big, Eisen said from his parked car in Baltimore, where he had traveled for a lawsuit to overturn President Donald Trump's cuts to AmeriCorps. They should move quickly. The Trump Epstein story is the story of the Trump administration—corruption benefiting his rich and powerful cronies at the expense of vulnerable people, Eisen explained as I lurked on the July call with his permission. The plan was to file a Hail Mary lawsuit to force the Department of Justice to release any documents in its possession that tie Epstein, a convicted child sex offender, to Trump. Eisen's team had already filed the request for anything that connects the two men, under the Freedom of Information Act. The FOIA is normally a weak tool for unlocking investigative records gathered for criminal investigations, but Eisen had a legal theory: Because the DOJ had argued under pressure after Bondi's announcement that the extraordinary public interest in the Epstein case required the unsealing of grand jury testimony, they could argue the same thing. And that was just the beginning. Eisen, who has pursued more than 100 legal matters against Trump since his second inauguration, explained that he wanted to try the case in the court of law and the court of public opinion. He asked for an update on an op ed he had written raising questions about a potential cover up of Trump's dealings with Epstein. He wanted a plan from Lavora Barnes, the former Michigan party chair, about how they would get elected leaders to discuss the Epstein records. He wanted a press plan to publicize the requests they had already filed, and the lawsuit they would file a few weeks later. A discussion followed about whether they should also try to intervene in the Justice Department's effort to unseal grand jury testimony, how many of the Epstein records they should demand to release, and how the Epstein issue fit with other arguments against Trump. We have an extremely strong horse right now. Let's just ride that, said Bill Kristol, the resident neoconservative. We want to know what's going on with the Epstein files. The first seven months of Trump's Oval Office do over have been, with occasional exception, a tale of ruthless domination. The Democratic opposition is feeble and fumbling, the federal bureaucracy traumatized and neutered. Corporate leaders come bearing gifts, the Republican Party has been scrubbed of dissent, and the street protests are diminished in size. Even the news media, a major check on Trump's power in his first term, have faded from their 2017 ferocity, hobbled by budget cuts, diminished ratings, and owners wary of crossing the president. One exception has stood out: A legal resistance led by a patchwork coalition of lawyers, public interest groups, Democratic state attorneys general, and unions has frustrated Trump's ambitions. Hundreds of attorneys and plaintiffs have stood up to him, feeding a steady assembly line of setbacks and judicial reprimands for a president who has systematically sought to break down limits on his own power. Of the 384 cases filed through August 28 against the Trump administration, 130 have led to orders blocking at least part of the president's efforts, and 148 cases await a ruling, according to a review by Just Security. Dozens of those rulings are the final word, with no appeal by the government, and others have been stayed on appeal, including by the Supreme Court. The only place we had any real traction was to start suing, because everything else was inert, Eisen told me. Trump v. the Rule of Law is like the fight of the century between Ali and Frazier, or the Thrilla in Manila or the Rumble in the Jungle. It's a great heavyweight battle. The legal scorecard so far is more than enough to provoke routine cries of judicial tyranny by Trump and his advisers. Unelected rogue judges are trying to steal years of time from a 4 year term, reads one typical social media complaint from Trump's senior adviser Stephen Miller. It's the most egregious theft one can imagine. But Miller's fury was, in part, misdirected. Before there can be rulings from judges, there must be plaintiffs who bring a case, investigators who collect facts and declarations about the harm caused, and lawyers who can shape it all into legal theories that make their way to judicial opinions. This backbone of the Trump resistance has as much in common with political organizing and investigative reporting as it does with legal theory. It should give great pause to the American public that parties are being recruited to harm the agenda the American people elected President Trump to implement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told me in a statement. Even those at the center of the fight against Trump view their greatest accomplishments as going beyond the temporary restraining orders or permanent injunctions they won. Without the court fights, the public would not know about many of the activities of Elon Musk's DOGE employees in the early months of the administration. They would not have read headlines in which federal judges accuse the president's team of perpetrating a sham or taking actions shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear. Kilmar Abrego Garcia would not have become a household name. Even cases that Trump ultimately won on appeal—such as his ability to fire transgender soldiers, defund scientific research, and dismiss tens of thousands of government employees—were delayed and kept in the news by the judicial process. In Trump immigration cases, it's one thing in public, another in court Since Inauguration Day, executive orders have been defanged or blocked, agency closures delayed, government employee firings reversed. Deportation flights have been delayed, law firms have freed themselves from Trump's retaliation, and foreign students have won the ability to continue studying at U.S. universities. Courts have forced the president to restore cut services and spending to AmeriCorps, the U.S. African Development Foundation, the CDC, and other agencies. They have upended an effort by the Office of Refugee Resettlement to make it more difficult to release unaccompanied minors from government custody and forced Trump to pay for foreign aid bills he had hoped to stiff arm. A federal appeals court ruled Friday that many of Trump's tariffs were illegal, setting up a likely hearing by the Supreme Court. The biggest victory, I think, has been in terms of highlighting the egregious nature of what Trump is doing, Rushab Sanghvi, the general counsel for the American Federation of Government Employees, told me. It is getting the public to understand how terrible it is. The groundwork for these victories was laid before Trump was even reelected, in a series of summits in 2023 and 2024. Universities hosted symposiums. Organized labor held private meetings. International experts, who had been studying Hungary's Viktor Orbn, warned that Trump would move quickly and try to overwhelm his opponents. We needed to flood the zone with rule of law shock and awe, Eisen told me after the Zoom call. The plan that emerged was not focused on centralizing a response, but on running a barrage of coordinated efforts. Attorneys general would represent states, advocacy groups such as Public Citizen and the ACLU would focus on their areas of expertise, and the unions would gather stories from their members and identify plaintiffs who could show harm. Atop this infrastructure, new organizations took shape, bringing in tens of millions of dollars to pay for it all. The offices of Democracy Forward, the single largest source of Trump's legal troubles, look from the inside like those of any corporate Washington law firm. From the building's corner windows, the group's more than 130 staff members—about half of them attorneys—can just make out the White House a couple of blocks down the street. By their count, they have filed 90 legal actions so far this year against Trump, often with union, nonprofit, or local government partners. Since 2021, the group had been operating on the assumption that American democracy was backsliding, and that the outcome of the 2024 election would merely determine whether it sped up or slowed down. By early 2024, it had established working groups with other organizations to begin sketching out the threat matrix of a second Trump term, placing particular focus on the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, which Trump distanced himself from while campaigning but has largely embraced while in office. We knew that if the federal landscape were to regress, people would have very few levers of power left, Skye Perryman, Democracy Forward's president, told me. They would be able to go to the streets and to vote, and they would be able to use litigation. Democracy Forward's first filing, to gain access to the deliberations of DOGE, hit the docket of the D.C. district court within hours of Trump taking the oath of office. Eisen's Democracy Defenders Fund, which has about two dozen attorneys, and three other legal groups filed similar suits at the same time. The decision to sue so soon was controversial. Perryman remembers some elected Democrats, among others, urging her to hold back. But she had been gaming out the moment for more than a year. She had a theory of the case and a coalition that saw the moment as she did. Right now, it's fight versus no fight, rather than left or center left, she told me. I run the country and the world.' One week later, the group faced its first crisis. The Office of Management and Budget released a memo telling federal agencies to temporarily pause all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance, a seismic order that threatened to close hundreds of federally funded programs around the country. Our litigators knew on the surface: This is unlawful, Megan Uzzell, Democracy Forward's director of external affairs, told me. But to build a case, they needed plaintiffs who had been harmed. That night, they worked the phones, signing up an array of groups that received federal funding and needed lawyers, such as the National Council of Nonprofits, the American Public Health Association, and the Main Street Alliance. We developed that, Uzzell said. Our litigators stayed up all night long developing the legal framework, and we were in court by 10 o—clock the next morning. The memo was stayed by a court that day and withdrawn by the White House the next. A pattern developed. Attorneys drafted legal arguments for potential moves by Trump, worked the phones to find plaintiffs and dig up facts, and then rushed to court. It is what the administration didn't think the legal community would be able to do, Perryman told me. This is highly factually intense work. It's designed that way so that the administration can go in and make a bunch of technical arguments, and we have met them every step of the way. Shortly after Trump's second inauguration, a school committee member for Easthampton, Massachusetts, received a Facebook Messenger text from an old college friend asking if she would be interested in going to court. Democracy Forward was preparing a lawsuit against Trump to challenge expected cuts to the Department of Education, and they were looking for plaintiffs. Easthampton is a former mill town in the western part of the state, with a school district of about 1,400 kids and 118 teachers, and a working class population that is far more politically mixed than much of the broadly liberal area. For the mayor and the school committee, going to court was not an easy decision. The superintendent and the district's lawyer were initially skeptical. But Sam Hunter, who received the outreach, along with his school committee colleague Laura Scott, decided to push ahead anyway. The conversation was, You are in 1938 Berlin. Which kind of person are you?' Scott remembered. This is the closest you are going to get to that moment. Democracy Forward also signed up the Somerville, Massachusetts, school district, along with a set of public employee unions. The case eventually merged with a similar lawsuit filed by Democratic state attorneys general. Weeks later, Hunter found himself in a Boston courtroom listening to the federal judge Myong J. Joun consider Trump's decision to eliminate about half of the staff at the Department of Education in the name of efficiency. The president had acknowledged that he could not get rid of the department altogether—Trump's stated goal—without an act of Congress. But his lawyers argued that he had the power to make personnel decisions in the meantime, even if that meant firing half of the employees. The question before the judge was whether the government's claims made constitutional sense. Joun, who was nominated by President Joe Biden, had before him a raft of details about Easthampton's concerns. The Education Department's Office for Civil Rights, which had been targeted for dismantling by Trump, had worked closely with the district to resolve issues of racial bias in how the schools disciplined their students. Their transportation options, class sizes, and accommodations for students with disabilities all depended on federal support. Do you drink coffee? Joun asked Deputy Assistant Attorney General Eric Hamilton at a hearing, in late April. I do, Hamilton responded for the government. I drink coffee every morning, the judge continued. I go to Dunkin' Donuts, and when I walk in, there is a person behind the counter. There is a person making a fresh pot of coffee. If I want a sandwich, there's a person at the sandwich station Let's say one morning there is no one there. I don't think the plaintiffs are saying that Dunkin' Donuts should hire these three employees back. I think what they're saying is they want their cup of coffee. At another point in the argument, Joun dismissed the government's claim that Trump's order was legal because it said in the text that it would not violate the law, comparing it to a teenager coming up with a nonsensical explanation for breaking a parent's rules. Hunter was surprised by the lighthearted tone. It was clear to him that Joun was on the side of the schools. Every time he made one of those jokes, I would look around and think: Are we all laughing? Hunter told me. Joun ruled that Trump's cuts overstepped his authority, quoting at length from the briefs that Easthampton had filed. The idea that Defendants' actions are merely a reorganization' is plainly not true, he wrote, issuing a preliminary injunction that prohibited the Department of Education from going through with its planned layoffs. Weeks later, the First Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld the ruling, sending it to the U.S. Supreme Court. All of our lawsuits tell stories, Randi Weingarten, the head of the American Federation of Teachers, which was a co plaintiff in the lawsuit and 11 others, told me. But you can't ask the judge to do all the work. If you want to prevail, you have to put real stories and real harm in front of the judge. The Supreme Court's liberals are trying to tell Americans something The Supreme Court ultimately voided Joun's ruling in an order that offered no reasoning. The majority apparently deems it more important to free the Government from paying employees it had no right to fire than to avert these very real harms while the litigation continues, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissent joined by the Court's two other Democratic appointees. The Department of Education employees were dismissed. But the law remains unsettled. Joun has ordered amended complaints to be filed by October 15, setting up a winter battle that could eventually end up back at the Supreme Court. Eisen believes that these legal struggles against Trump are just the opening minutes of a much larger battle. He did not win that round. We did not win either, he told me, but we held our own, and that in itself is a victory. The Supreme Court, which has so far appeared more favorable to Trump than district courts, could ultimately tilt the scorecard in the president's favor, as the justices begin to consider the substance of the legal questions presented by Trump. But the ultimate score will not be recorded on just the appellate docket or in the list of injunctions that are left to stand. Organizers are tracking Trump's approval ratings, as well, anticipating the effect the legal efforts could have on the 2026 midterm elections. Despite the bluster from the White House, the president has been losing public support. He is losing in court in ways that he did not anticipate, Perryman told me. Voters have the power to provide the ultimate check. The president is also providing more fodder for more lawsuits. The many aggressive tactics by ICE have spawned new cases, as has the deployment of federal officers and National Guardsmen to try to crack down on crime in D.C. Eisen is working on a plan for a lawsuit against Trump that challenges the financial benefits he and his family have enjoyed since taking office. The battle, in short, is just beginning. The demand for lawyers that are willing to defend people from the government is exponentially greater today than it was on day one, Perryman told me. We believe the next 200 days are going to be even more significant than the first 200 days."

    "content":"Valued users! We understand that over the past 250 odd years, you have come to rely on the services provided by the U.S. of A.: postal delivery, representative government, edible food, clean water, lifesaving vaccines, and no kings—ever, guaranteed. Well, 250 years of free is enough. Now we demand $TRUMP coin. Was America perfect before? Hell, no! Some of these features arrived pretty late for some of you, and for that, we used to be sorry. We were so excited to reach 340 million free users. But now it's time to streamline our product so that it appeals more to paid subscribers, and that means some changes for everyone else. We are adding a lot of features no one asked for that will make your experience worse and also cost a lot of money! Freedom isn't free! Nor is it, exactly, the freedom you've been used to! Yes, that is the National Guard in your city. We know that you didn't request it; it's just a new feature we're rolling out, possibly for 30 days, possibly for even longer! You were pretty vocal about what attracted you to America in the first place: personal liberty, economic opportunity, something called the American dream, and, of course, the perennial threat of gun violence. (That last feature developed over time, but it seems that our users are pretty attached? We offered you many opportunities to opt out.) But we knew what was really keeping you here: inertia, and the challenge of finding an alternative that sells decent breakfast burritos. We are banking on that going forward. We hope the difficulty of switching to another provider will keep you here while we slowly remove all the features that you came for and replace them with AI generated slop. We are also changing a lot of our graphic design to extract any remaining soul from our product. (We saw how well that went for Cracker Barrel!) This comes with branding updates too! Instead of a Nice, Friendly Place Where You Can Work Hard and Have a Better Life, we're now That Place With More Than 60,000 People Currently in ICE Detention. Sydney Sweeney's jeans are running the Department of Homeland Security. Don't worry. Our new CEO does hate a large portion of our current user base, but he's not totally ignorant of the culture here. He is very excited to bring back some things that past users described as great, such as Depression, Recession, and White Shark Attacks. It was also his brilliant idea to add the features of autocracy—State Control of Business, General Encouragement of Groveling, Masked Men Who Yank Your Neighbors Into an Unmarked Van to Whisk Them Off to a Gulag—to our core democratic product. You heard it right: The government you knew for Weather Data and Medical Research is going all in on Despot Whims. This costs money, so bedrock features such as Separation of Powers, No Troop Quartering, and Due Process are being phased out, even for premium subscribers. We are also getting rid of most of our Health and Science. But you can have a career in ICE. We are retaining some features for premium users. Want rule of law? That's premium. The right to run your company without government interference? That's a paid feature now. An explanation from the Supreme Court as to why it just ruled against you? Maybe! Why is this happening now? Simple. You all know the classic process of enshittification, as coined by Cory Doctorow, from your experience with the tech products that touch every aspect of your life. First, you have a product that everyone enjoys, and then, when someone decides that that product needs to make a profit, everything about it gets gradually worse and worse until the whole thing is ruined. This is why, whenever you open America's homepage, an unwanted video starts to play. Instead of the medical recommendation you were looking for, there is a man with one weird trick, whom doctors hate! (He is the health and human services secretary!) All of the articles are now written by AI, except Article I, which has disappeared entirely. Why are these changes necessary? They aren't! Can you opt out of them? No! Tariffs, a share of Intel, and a weirdly conciliatory attitude toward Russian President Vladimir Putin are now the default for all users. Also, everything that used to be free now isn't: speech, assembly, and petition, to name just three. Eggs now cost $800—both because they are very expensive to produce and because we are trying to make the dollar worthless. What happened to my free press? Sorry! That's paywalled. We have gotten rid of the people responsible for making gradual improvements to America, and our new team wants to see exponential profits for shareholders. It's unclear who these shareholders are, exactly! We thought all of us were, but it might just be our CEO? The executive mansion definitely seems fancier than we remember, and he has a new private plane. You can still keep using America, and depending on your version, it may remain functional for some length of time. But if you'd like to subscribe to our premium product, there's no better opportunity than right now! Please hand $5,000,000 in unmarked bills to our CEO. He may spare you."

    "content":"Last week, I paid a $26.05 tariff on a small purchase from the United Kingdom. On August 29, a federal appeals court ruled that the U.S. government had no right to take that money. It allowed the tariff to remain in place until October, pending further litigation. But the Trump administration has lost every round of this fight to date. If it keeps losing, the question will sooner or later arise: What happens to my $26.05? In a filing with the court of appeals, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that overturning Donald Trump's tariffs would count as a dangerous diplomatic embarrassment. And Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned that an about face would have devastating and dire consequences. One of those consequences might be that the U.S. government would suddenly owe tens of millions of Americans hundreds of millions of dollars, and, in that scenario, would face total administrative chaos repaying the money it wrongfully took. I didn't pay my $26.05 to the U.S. government. I paid it to the shipper, who in turn (I presume) remitted one big check to the U.S. government. How does that process get reversed? It's easy to type an answer: The U.S. government should refund one big check to the shipper, who will in turn reverse all of its small credit card collections to its customers. In real life, however, that is not so easily done. This particular shipper, DHL, has exited the U.S. market because of the havoc created by Trump's tariffs. In April, DHL stopped shipping packages worth more than $800 to the United States. In August, it quit the under $800 business too. By sheer chance, my U.K. order was placed on DHL's last package shipping day to the United States, August 22. Listen: Trump's tariff disaster If the Trump administration is compelled to undo its tariff regime, it will have to send a new message to DHL: Remember how you quit the U.S. market so as not to deal with our unpredictable and intolerable regulatory burden? Guess what, suckers? !uitting did not save you. You have to redo all that burden you fled to escape. But this time, you have to do it backwards. Maybe DHL has the technology to cope with a small dollar refund obligation. But what about all of those companies that collected money that's much harder to trace? Almost every U.S. producer of almost every good and service is paying more for almost every input because of Trump's tariffs. But determining who paid what to whom and when will create a tangle of claims and counterclaims. The U.S. government collected $94 billion in tariff revenue in the first half of 2025. Not all of that money was taken illegally, but most of it was. How big a tax is that? Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act contained a provision advertised as no tax on tips. This measure is projected to reduce federal revenues by $32 billion over 10 years. (It expires in 2028 but could be renewed.) So Trump's illegal tax collections in the first half of 2025 exceeded the total value of his most touted concession to low income Americans by at least two to one, and probably closer to three to one. Creating a huge mess is a consistent Trump method. Over and over again, the administration commits to actions at, or beyond, the outermost limit of executive power, then confronts the courts with a risk of chaos if the limits are enforced. Thousands of individuals have been detained and imprisoned without due process, including the opportunity to argue that the authorities have mistaken their identity or ignored their lawful residency status. If the courts allow these detentions, then habeas corpus is more or less dead in America. If the courts refuse, brace yourself for a tsunami of wrongful arrest litigation. If Trump is allowed to keep the proceeds of his illegal taxes, then Congress has lost the power of the purse and Article I of the Constitution has been repealed. If Trump must return his illegal taxes, then millions of disgorgement actions will follow. I probably won't sue for my $26.05. But I'll sign my claim over to any class action attorney who wants it. Trump is chaos. So President Bill Clinton warned at the Democratic convention in 2024. So it is proving true, on a scale that is only beginning to come into view."

Dear James, I've been married to my husband for 35 years. He is 88 and I'm 79. I was in love with him during our courtship. He showed interest in me, appeared to enjoy doing things with me, and was affectionate, kind, and communicative. But in the first year or two of our marriage, most of that dropped away. When I told him that I didn't feel loved, he didn't seem to care. He apparently believed that once the courtship and honeymoon were over, he could start behaving like an entitled jerk (my words, not his). I've made attempts to leave, none of which panned out. During my third attempt, about 10 years ago, it became clear to me that my husband was in cognitive decline. I had suspected it for some time, but his behavior as we went over logistics confirmed that he no longer understood what was happening. Now, here I am—the sole caretaker for a husband with full blown dementia. It's been awful. He rarely speaks to me. When I walk into the room, he doesn't look up. I'm expected to listen to his news and conundrums, but he doesn't have time for mine. I do the laundry and cooking and shopping, and he hasn't said thank you in years. Sex is at zero. We have no family nearby. We're living on our government pensions and can't afford caretakers. My husband isn't far enough along to qualify for long term care—which we probably couldn't afford anyway. Our mutual social contacts have drifted away. I have made some new women friends, and I still go out for a coffee now and then, but I can't be gone for more than a few hours before my husband's anxiety maxes out. I'm not unkind enough to leave him now, but I am not kind enough to treat him with the love and concern he deserves in his confused state. How do I reconcile this? I want to go. I want him to go. That's not likely to happen until one of us dies. Is there a way I can curate my feelings and attitude, so I don't cringe when I read books about dementia care, and they keep using the term your loved one—which he has not been to me, nor I to him, for decades? Dear Reader, This one goes out to the carers—to the unpaid, at home carers; the carers for husbands; the carers for wives; the carers for parents; the carers for disabled children or siblings, who on good days and bad, with hearts overflowing or through gritted teeth, get the job done. Who renew the routine, repeat the steps, climb back onto the spiral, whether it feels like a joyous practice or a scene from Samuel Beckett's Endgame, or both. I find myself reaching for religious language when I think about what you're doing: You are consecrating yourself to the well being of another—in some cases, or at some moments, a difficult, intractable, and unable to be grateful other. You are making a liturgy out of the everyday. In your case, is it possible for you to separate the husband who made you so miserable from the man who now relies on your care? I wonder. Maybe it isn't. Maybe the symptoms of his cognitive decline are inextricable from what seemed to you to be his general self absorption and thoughtlessness. But the situation is different now: He's sick, and he needs you. And you have stepped up with strength and generosity, even if you can't manufacture feelings that aren't there. About those feelings, by the way, you should be experiencing no guilt whatsoever. These books about dementia care that you've been reading—every time you come across the words your loved one, try substituting your huge pain in the ass. Meanwhile, is there anything you can do to take care of yourself? To lighten the burden? Think hard about this—think about those pockets of the day when you can get a break, and about how to make the most of that break. Maybe you sit in a diner and read a book (one definition of bliss, for me). Maybe you start playing Grand Theft Auto. Whatever irrigates the imagination and allows the soul to exhale. You're the expert here. You know exactly how the system of caring for your husband runs, and you know what you need. And if you allow yourself a minute or two of unharried consideration, I guarantee that you'll come up with some angles. In admiration, James By submitting a letter, you are agreeing to let The Atlantic use it in part or in full, and we may edit it for length and\/or clarity."

    "content":"At their meeting in Beijing today, the Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin made a show of how close they've become. Putin and Xi, referring to each other as friends, praised the strength of their relationship as their two countries advanced an agreement to build a gas pipeline that would bind their economies even more tightly together. The continued friendship between the two leaders is a stark reminder that Donald Trump, despite his attempted outreach to Russia and talk of ununiting America's two major rivals, hasn't redrawn the global map of strategic alliances to his advantage. But here's the curious thing: Neither has China. Within weeks of the inauguration, many observers—I was one of them—warned that by courting Russia and punishing Europe, Trump might be handing the world and, most alarmingly, Washington's traditional allies to China. That Beijing would welcome such an opportunity seemed obvious: China had often sought to drive a wedge between the U.S. and its friends, but lately Xi had strained China's relations with Europe by supporting Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Now Beijing could patch things up by presenting itself as a more reliable partner than Washington. Read: What is a reverse Nixon,' and can Trump pull it off? But to the extent that Beijing has made any such effort so far, it was short lived. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi reportedly told the European Union's top diplomat in July that China could not accept a Russian loss in Ukraine, because that might lead the United States to focus its energies on containing China's rise. This position on Ukraine, combined with a hard stance on trade issues, has left China unable to improve its ties with Europe, as was evident at a Beijing summit with EU leaders in July, during which the two sides found hardly any common ground. China hasn't done much to shake up American alliances in Asia, either. Beijing has continued to alienate its neighbors by aggressively asserting claims to nearly all of the South China Sea; in August, two Chinese naval vessels collided there as they tried to chase away a Philippine coast guard boat. South Korea's newly elected president, Lee Jae Myung, has expressed an interest in improving relations with China, but rather than seize on that, Xi has made clear that his government's sympathies lie with Seoul's primary adversary, North Korea, whose dictator, Kim Jong Un, will visit China this week for a celebration of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II in Asia. In recent days, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended the Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting in Tianjin—his first trip to China in seven years. But Modi is not likely to rush into Xi's arms, given China's role in supplying India's chief rival, Pakistan, with fighter jets and missiles used in the recent clashes over Kashmir. New Delhi is embroiled in a trade dispute with Trump, but India remains a member of the Quad, a partnership with the U.S., Japan, and Australia aimed at counterbalancing Beijing in Asia. This pattern of decision making suggests that Beijing has not made much of Trump's disruptions to American alliances. Rather, China is still treating the established democratic powers—the United States, the European Union, Japan, and their partners—as the main impediments to its global ambitions. Within that strategic calculus, Putin remains a crucial partner for China. Last week, Xi told Vyacheslav Volodin, the chair of the Russian Duma, that the two countries should jointly safeguard their security and work for a more just and equitable international order—in other words, one no longer dominated by the U.S. and its allies, according to an official Chinese government summary of his comments. Read: The Iran China Russia axis crumbles when it matters That Washington, under Trump, has abandoned the language, and seemingly the agenda, of shared values with fellow democracies does not seem to have altered this calculation. Chinese leaders still see Western countries as a unit and do not see that there's enough profit to be gained by trying to play them against one another, Sergey Radchenko, an expert on China Russia relations at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, told me. As a consequence, he added, Chinese leaders need Russia as a counterbalance to that. Alexander Gabuev, the director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, argues that to Xi and Putin, Trump is simply another president seeking to extend and maintain U.S. dominance. From the perspective of China's leaders, the Americans and Europeans like us to be weak, poor, and looking up to them, which we don't accept, Gabuev told me.That's the narrative that's really impossible to change under current circumstances. China does seek to extend its influence within the global South at American expense. On Monday, Xi criticized hegemonism and protectionism—a not so veiled dig at Washington—and proposed a new initiative to strengthen the role of developing countries in international decision making. But neither Russia nor China seems to have fully clocked the opportunity that Trump's withdrawal of the United States from global leadership presents. For Russia, courting better relations with American allies might help relieve the economic pressure that sanctions have imposed. In China's case, a more subtle and flexible foreign policy could scramble long established relationships and reshape the global order. Trump's disdain for foreign policy precedent and erratic flip flops will continue to open opportunities for Xi and Putin to expand their global influence at Washington's expense. But wooing Western partners would likely involve some compromises that these dictators are probably unwilling to make. China remains intent on, for example, pursuing technological superiority, upgrading its military, and partnering with Putin—all policies that stand in the way of improving relations with American allies. By continuing to align with each other and treat the West as a unified adversary with common values and interests, Xi and Putin are, in effect, holding the U.S. alliance system together. They are also leaving open the possibility that the next U.S. president can repair the global order that sustained American dominance."

    "content":"The story we got about World War II is all wrong, a guest told Tucker Carlson on his podcast two weeks ago. I think that's right, replied Carlson. The guest, a Cornell chemistry professor named David Collum, then spelled out what he meant: One can make the argument we should have sided with Hitler and fought Stalin. Such sentiments might sound shocking to the uninitiated, but they are not to Carlson's audience. In fact, the notion that the German dictator was unfairly maligned has become a running theme on Carlson's show—and beyond. Last September, Carlson interviewed a man named Darryl Cooper, whom he dubbed the most important popular historian working in the United States today. Cooper's conception of honest history soon became clear: He suggested that British Prime Minister Winston Churchill might have been the chief villain of the Second World War, with Nazi Germany at best coming in second. The day after the episode aired, Cooper further downplayed Hitler's genocidal ambitions, writing on social media that the German leader had sought peace with Europe and merely wanted to reach an acceptable solution to the Jewish problem. He did not explain why the Jews should have been considered a problem in the first place. What is it about Hitler? Why is he the most evil? the far right podcaster Candace Owens asked in July 2024. The first thing people would say is: Well, an ethnic cleansing almost took place.' And now I offer back: You mean like we actually did to the Germans.' A repeat guest on Carlson's show, Owens defended him after his conversation with Cooper. Many Americans are learning that WW2 history is not as black and white as we were taught and some details were purposefully omitted from our textbooks, she wrote on X. These Reich rehabilitators are not fringe figures. Carlson's show ranks among the top podcasts in America. He spoke before President Donald Trump on the final night of the 2024 Republican National Convention, and his son serves as a deputy press secretary to Vice President J. D. Vance, who owes his office in part to Carlson's advocacy. Owens has millions of followers on YouTube, Instagram, and X, and over the past six months, she has been interviewed by some of the nation's most popular podcasters, including the comedian Theo Von and the ESPN personality Stephen A. Smith. Her output has attained sufficient notoriety that she is currently being sued by French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, over her repeated claims that the French first lady was actually born a man. Cooper, the would be World War II revisionist, publishes the top selling history newsletter on the entire Substack platform. Yair Rosenberg: The anti Semitic revolution on the American right Why does a potent portion of the American right seek to rehabilitate Hitler? The Nazi apologetics are partly an attention seeking attempt at provocation—an effort to signal iconoclasm by transgressing one of society's few remaining taboos. But there is more to the story than that. Carlson and his fellow travelers on the far right correctly identify the Second World War as a pivot point in America's understanding of itself and its attitude toward its Jewish citizens. The country learned hard lessons from the Nazi Holocaust about the catastrophic consequences of conspiratorial prejudice. Today, a growing constituency on the right wants the nation to unlearn them. Before World War II, the United States was a far more anti Semitic place than it is now. Far from joining the conflict to rescue Europe's Jews, the country was largely unsympathetic to their plight. In 1938, on the eve of the Holocaust, Gallup found that 54 percent of Americans believed that the persecution of Jews in Europe has been partly their own fault, and that another 11 percent thought it was entirely their fault. In other words, as the Nazis prepared to exterminate the Jews, most Americans blamed the victims. The same week that the Kristallnacht pogrom left thousands of synagogues and Jewish businesses in ruins, 72 percent of Americans opposed allowing a larger number of Jewish exiles from Germany to come to the United States to live. Months later, 67 percent opposed a bill aimed at accepting child refugees from Germany; the idea never made it to a congressional vote. Many Americans worried, however illogically, that fleeing Jews might be German spies, a vanishingly rare occurrence. Those with suspicions included President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who suggested in 1940 that some refugees could be engaged in espionage under compulsion from the Nazis, especially Jewish refugees. This climate of paranoia and hostility had deadly consequences. In 1939, the U.S. and Canada turned away the M.S. St. Louis, which carried nearly 1,000 Jewish refugees. The ship was forced to return to Europe, where hundreds of the passengers were captured and killed by the Germans. Restrained by public sentiment, Roosevelt not only kept the country's refugee caps largely in place but also rejected pleas to bomb the Auschwitz concentration camp and the railway tracks that led to it. When the United States finally entered the war, it did so not out of any special sense of obligation to the Jews but to defend itself after the attack on Pearl Harbor. That indifference to the Holocaust was immediately dispelled when the Allied Forces liberated several of the Nazi camps where millions of Jews had been murdered. Entering the gates of these sadistic sites, American service members came face to face with unspeakable Nazi atrocities—rotting piles of naked corpses, gas chambers, thousands of emaciated adults. Denial gave way to revulsion. I thought of some of the stories I previously had read about Dachau and was glad of the chance to see for myself just to prove once and for all that what I had heard was propaganda, Sergeant Horace Evers wrote to his family in May 1945. But no it wasn't propaganda at all If anything some of the truth had been held back. Timothy W. Ryback: How Hitler dismantled a democracy in 53 days Dwight Eisenhower, the supreme commander of the Allied Forces in Europe and future U.S. president, personally went to Ohrdruf, a subcamp of Buchenwald and the first Nazi camp liberated by American troops. I made the visit deliberately, he cabled to Washington, in order to be in position to give first hand evidence of these things if ever, in the future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to propaganda.' Eisenhower then requested that members of Congress and prominent journalists be brought to the camps to see and document the horrors themselves. I pray you to believe what I have said about Buchenwald, the legendary CBS broadcaster Edward R. Murrow told his listeners after touring the camp. I reported what I saw and heard, but only part of it. For most of it, I have no words. Two thirds of Europe's Jews had been murdered. American soldiers, drafted from across the United States, returned home bearing witness to what they had encountered. Anti Semitism was right there, it had been carried to the ultimate, and I knew that that was something we had to get rid of because I had experienced it, Sergeant Leon Bass, a Black veteran whose segregated unit entered Buchenwald, later testified. In this way, the American people learned firsthand where rampant anti Jewish prejudice led—and the country was transformed. Americans began to understand themselves as the ones who'd defeated the Nazis and saved the Jews. Slowly but surely, anti Semitism became un American. But today, those lessons—like the people who learned them—are passing away, and a wave of propagandists with a very different agenda has arisen to fill the void they left behind. Over the past few years, Tucker Carlson and his co ideologues have begun insinuating anti Semitic ideas into the public discourse. The former Fox News host has described Ben Shapiro, perhaps the most prominent American Jewish conservative, and those like him as foreign subversives who don't care about the country at all. He has also promoted a lightly sanitized version of the white supremacist Great Replacement theory that has inspired multiple anti Semitic massacres on American soil. Candace Owens has accused Israel of involvement in the 9\/11 attacks and the JFK assassination, and claimed that a Jewish pedophile cult controls the world. (Like many pushing such slanders, she has apparently discerned that replacing Jews with Israel or Zionists grants age old conspiracy theories new legitimacy.) In March, an influencer named Ian Carroll—who has a combined 3.8 million social media followers, and whose work has been shared by Elon Musk—joined Joe Rogan, arguably the most popular podcaster in America, to expound without challenge about how a giant group of Jewish billionaires is running a sex trafficking operation targeting American politicians and business people. Before America entered World War II, reactionaries such as the famed aviator Charles Lindbergh and the Catholic radio firebrand Father Charles Coughlin inveighed against the country's tiny Jewish population, accusing it of controlling America's institutions and dragging the U.S. to war. Their greatest danger to this country lies in their large ownership and influence in our motion pictures, our press, our radio and our government, Lindbergh declared of American Jews in 1941. Why is there persecution in Germany today? asked Coughlin after Kristallnacht. Jewish persecution only followed after Christians first were persecuted. For these men and their millions of supporters, behind every perceived social and political problem lay a sinister Jewish culprit. Read: What Tucker Carlson's spin on World War II really says The 21st century heirs of Lindbergh and Coughlin seek to turn back the clock to a time when such sentiments were seen by many as sensible rather than scandalous. These far right figures have correctly ascertained that to change what is possible in American politics, they need to change how America talks about itself and its past. The reason I keep focusing on this is probably the same reason you're doing it, Carlson told Darryl Cooper, the amateur Holocaust historian. I think it's central to the society we live in, the myths upon which it's built. I think it's also the cause of the destruction of Western civilization—these lies. Carlson couches his claims in layers of intellectual abstraction. Others are less coy. Hitler burned down the trans clinics, arrested the Rothschild bankers, and gave free homes to families, the former mixed martial artist Jake Shields told his 870,000 followers on X last week. Does this sound like the most evil man who ever lived? The post received 44,000 likes. (Shields has also denied that a single Jew died in gas chambers.) Hitler was right about y—all, said Myron Gaines, a manosphere podcaster with some 2 million followers across platforms, referring to Jews last year. You guys come into a country, you push your pornography, you push your fuckin' central banking, you push your degeneracy, you push the LGBT community, you push all this fuckin' bullshit into a society, you destroy it from within. These influencers are less respectable than Carlson, but their views are precisely the ones that more presentable propagandists like him are effectively working to mainstream. After Carlson's guest last month suggested that the U.S. should have sided with Hitler, Shields reposted the clip. Had Carlson and his cohort attempted their revisionism 20 years ago, they would have encountered a chorus of contradiction from real people who had experienced the history they sought to rewrite and know where its conspiratorial calumnies lead. But today, most of those people are dead, and a new generation is rising that never witnessed the Holocaust firsthand or heard about it from family and friends who did. Late last year, David Shor, one of the Democratic Party's top data scientists, surveyed some 130,000 voters about whether they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Jewish people. Hardly anyone over the age of 70 said their view was unfavorable. More than a quarter of those under 25 did. The question is not whether America's self understanding is changing; it's how far that change will go—and what the consequences will be."

    "content":"When Anna De Souza was in her early 30s, she asked her ob gyn when she should start thinking about having kids. When you were 26, she remembers the doctor saying. She was surprised. She'd had some sense that fertility decreases with age but didn't know how significant the drop off was. No doctor had ever told her, and she certainly didn't learn about it in school. She took sex ed at her New Jersey high school in the late 1990s, but she said it focused mostly on trying to scare students out of having sex. She remembers little about the class besides watching a graphic VHS video of a woman giving birth. De Souza, a journalist in Philadelphia, now wishes that class had included the basics of fertility and reproduction. A more robust sex ed program, she thinks, could have prompted her to check her egg count or freeze her eggs when she was younger, or even try to have kids sooner. She ended up having twins at 36, after two rounds of IVF, and later a son, also through IVF. But if she'd known more about fertility earlier in her life, she might have tried for a family the good, old fashioned, fun way, she said, instead of the needles way. Teenagers, she believes, should understand that just because they don't want kids at 16 doesn't mean they won't want kids ever. She's far from the only person who feels this way. Fertility doctors and other experts told me that better sex education—with a curriculum that explains both how to prevent pregnancy and how to boost fertility—could help more families have the number of children they desire. This is especially essential as more people wait until they're older to start trying to have kids. According to the doctors I spoke with, many patients arrive at fertility clinics filled with misconceptions about their own reproductive biology. It's been stunning how ill informed so many people are, Michael Zinaman, a reproductive endocrinologist in New York, told me. Read: The questions sex ed students always ask The doctors I spoke with pointed to some things that they believe all women and men should know about fertility but in many cases don't. Most obvious, getting pregnant is easier when you're young. When women see stories in the media about female celebrities who have a baby at 50, Rashmi Kudesia, a reproductive endocrinologist in Houston, told me, they might assume it's likely to happen for them, too. Additionally, Kudesia said some of her patients don't realize that their being underweight or overweight can contribute to interfertility, as can untreated sexually transmitted infections. Or they don't know that doctors advise women to take a prenatal vitamin containing folic acid—essential to the development of a fetus—even when they're only thinking about getting pregnant. Men should know, too, that lifestyle factors, including alcohol and tobacco use, can affect their sperm quality, which in turn can affect their partner's likelihood of getting pregnant. Those who may end up trying to conceive later in life could benefit from even more information. Zinaman told me that many of his patients don't know that a woman has a brief window each month during which it's possible to get pregnant. Kudesia said that some of her patients come in with overly optimistic views of how well treatments such as IVF can work. Surveys of women's knowledge of fertility lend support to these anecdotes. A 2023 study of nearly 1,800 women ages 18 to 29 found that only 59 percent knew the phase during the menstrual cycle when they were most likely to get pregnant, and most erroneously thought that a woman's ovaries continually make eggs until she reaches menopause. (Women are born with all of the eggs they'll ever have, and the eggs' quality and quantity diminish with time.) In a 2016 study of mostly low income women, just over half knew what ovulation meant, and fewer than a third knew when it occurs. In a 2017 study, reproductive age women correctly answered an average of only about 16 out of 29 fertility questions, covering topics such as the percentage of pregnancies that end in miscarriage and the lifestyle factors that decrease fertility. Women studying to become doctors fared little better, answering an average of only about 19 questions correctly, leading the authors to conclude that fertility knowledge is low among U.S. women of reproductive age, including those with children and even among medical trainees. Even women who are actively trying to get pregnant tend to be underinformed: A 2021 review found that women who wanted to conceive had low to moderate fertility knowledge. In a 2022 study of women struggling to conceive, only a quarter correctly recognized the week during their cycle when they had the highest chance of getting pregnant. This lack of knowledge has real consequences: A lot of the misunderstanding around fertility and reproductive health lends people to either not be able to have the family size that they desire, Kudesia said, or to have lost a lot of time along the way. That's in part why Kudesia and some other doctors think that fertility should be taught as a standard part of sex ed in schools. Although doctors could try to give patients this information themselves, most doctors' appointments are too brief for a long lecture on ovulation, and some patients don't bring up fertility challenges until after they've started trying to have a baby. What I hear all the time is people thinking that, Well, if my age is a concern with regards to fertility, my doctor will bring it up to me, she said. And that's definitely not a fair assumption. What's more, doctors who specialize in fertility often have long wait times for appointments, and some don't accept insurance, putting their counsel out of reach for many. Better sex ed in middle school and high school, including lessons on ovulation and fertility cycles, could help make people aware, earlier in their life, of the factors they need to consider if they eventually want to have children. Fertility education in school also has the potential to reach far more people than individual doctors can; not everyone goes to the doctor every year, but almost everyone goes to middle school and high school. Fertility education efforts haven't been studied extensively, but the limited research that does exist suggests that they can be effective. Studies from Canada, Spain, and Japan found that exposure to information about fertility at least temporarily increased young adults' knowledge of the topic. Conversely, the consequences of educators not broaching the topic in schools can be significant: In a 2019 study based on interviews with 54 American women experiencing infertility, several noted the conspicuous absence of conversations about reproductive health and fertility from their schools' sex education. One 39 year old woman told the study's authors that if she and her husband had known more about fertility earlier, we would not have waited so long before trying to conceive. Some places have already implemented more robust sex ed in their schools. California recently enacted a Know Your Period law, modeled after a similar law in Washington, D.C., which requires schools to teach all middle and high school students about the menstrual cycle and menopause. And about 500 school districts across the country use a comprehensive curriculum called Rights, Respect, Responsibility, which covers menstruation, the fertile window, and how an embryo implants in a uterus. Kudesia praised one lesson from the curriculum as excellent, saying it seemed like an age appropriate way of discussing things. She told me, When we're in high school or younger, we often get the impression that if you just touch a boy, you're going to get pregnant. A more well rounded sex ed curriculum would show that it's not quite that simple. Read: Men might be the key to an American baby boom But these programs face the same headwinds that sex ed in general contends with. Attempts to expand sex ed in schools typically fail for a few reasons, among them that some school districts can't afford to train teachers and develop or purchase additional curricula about sexuality, and anything having to do with sex and bodies can be highly contentious among parents. Kudesia noted that the Rights, Respect, Responsibility curriculum might not be popular in today's political climate, because it includes discussions of gender identity, a fact that the curriculum has been scrutinized for in the past. The Trump administration, too, is keen on the idea of fertility education, though not primarily through school based sex ed: In April, The New York Times reported that a policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation proposed to the White House that it use government funds to educate women about their menstrual cycles. And in July, the Times wrote that the administration was offering a $1.5 million grant to start an infertility training center aimed at helping women conceive. But Robin Jensen, a University of Utah communications professor who has researched sex ed, points out that these programs seem as if they're aiming to increase the U.S. birth rate and not to also help people prevent pregnancy, if they desire. Fertility education is needed in sex education, Jensen told me. But it needs to be the kind that is designed to increase fertility awareness and knowledge across the board rather than the kind that offers only part of the story. Young people themselves seem to want to have this more expansive, impartial information about reproduction. The idea for California's period bill came from a high school student, Sriya Srinivasan, who had stopped menstruating for three years, didn't understand why, and felt too embarrassed to ask her doctor. She told me that she thinks kids should have a place to learn about reproduction other than the internet—a place where, as she put it about a hypothetical student, I can sit and listen to this, and I don't have to feel that stigma or shame from searching it up online myself, or I don't have to feel the stigma of my family shaming me. Ideally, Srinivasan and other teenagers would come away from sex ed understanding both how not to get pregnant and how to get pregnant: basic information about the human body that the body's owner deserves to know. *Illustration by Vivian Dehning.

The systems had gotten clunky over time, he said. Something needed to change. So Hiebert was open to seeing how President Donald Trump might change it. Then the Trump administration canceled a major grant making program that helped states and towns build infrastructure to weather future storms and fires—a core mission of Hiebert's department. (Last month, a judge temporarily blocked the administration from reallocating its funds.) Some FEMA leaders had been fired, and contract renewals for a substantial number of his on the ground employees were in jeopardy. Doing his job would only get harder, if not impossible, he thought. Hiebert also found out his wife was expecting twins. They already had two children, and suddenly the risk that his own role or perhaps his whole agency could be erased at any time looked more personally threatening. If something happened and I were fired, with twins we would be destitute, he told me. He left FEMA in June and took a job in disaster contracting, at AECOM, a main player in the sector. The AECOM job paid better, Hiebert told me, but more attractive was its security. Whatever FEMA's exact fate under Trump, disasters will still happen. Since many states lack their own cadre of emergency management expertise or manpower, they will likely pay private contractors to step in where the federal government has stepped out. And many will be staffed by former federal employees. Right now, the federal government's expertise in disasters is essentially transferring to private companies. Hiebert estimates that between one third and one half of his colleagues in FEMA hazard mitigation leadership have taken private sector jobs, or will soon. Marion McFadden, who oversaw disaster grants at the Department of Housing and Urban Development during the Biden administration, told me that many of the HUD executives she worked with are moving to the private sector. She herself is now a vice president at the emergency management contractor IEM, and knows of multiple contractors who have been preparing for an influx of business by hiring disaster readiness corps. These would be the exact same people who formerly worked directly for FEMA, she said. The path from government emergency management to disaster consulting is well trod: Former FEMA administrators and state emergency management heads have gone on to lead consulting firms, and companies such as AECOM and IEM stock their ranks with former government employees. But the disaster managers and experts I spoke with said the current exodus from the public to the private sector is unique in its scope. It's a period like I've never seen before in the opportunity to hire experienced folks, Bryan Koon, the CEO of IEM, told me. The Trump administration says its aim in shrinking or possibly dissolving FEMA is to push more responsibility for disasters onto the states. This strategy is an inversion of what led President Jimmy Carter to create the agency in 1979: Governors, frustrated by the lack of a coordinating agency for disasters, requested it. Having 50 state agencies ready to respond to relatively rare catastrophes is inefficient; a federal disaster agency would have the advantages of standardized protocols, experience, and staff who can be deployed where needed. Now they may be largely on their own again. And most states, lacking their own cadre of expertise or manpower, will need support to fill in the gaps left by the federal government. States might lean on each other more than they already do, but they will surely also turn more to private contractors, many of which will now be staffed by former federal employees. Private contractors already play a significant role in disaster recovery. A storm victim arriving at a disaster recovery center might speak with a private consultant working alongside federal, state, or nonprofit personnel. Contractors are regularly hired to clear debris, do welfare checks, and complete damage assessments. Sometimes FEMA hires contractors directly, but states and cities hire them too—often to help make sense of the labyrinthine financial assistance process for disasters. This, many experts both in and outside of government agree, is part of the problem that needs fixing. Grants for recovery come from 30 different federal government agencies that fund 91 different recovery programs, Brock Long, a former head of FEMA under the first Trump administration, told me. Long works in private disaster contracting now too, as the executive chairman of Hagerty Consulting, and he said that, after getting billions of dollars promised by the federal government, most local leaders look like deer in a headlights—they have no idea what they're entitled to, how to seek the money, or use it within all of the rules and stipulations. That's where firms like his come in. The grant process also often involves lawyers, and years long fights in which states try to recoup disaster funds from the feds. Right now it takes a team of lawyers to get a claim through. That's why I have a job. It's insane, Danielle Aymond, a lawyer at the firm Baker Donelson and former executive counsel for Louisiana's emergency management office, told me. Fundamentally, the disaster consultants I spoke with felt that they were helping people at some of their worst moments. They tended to view their private sector work as akin to the work they did in government: A lot of us still see ourselves as public servants, Hiebert said. Still, for profit companies can come with their own complications. Horne LLP, a consulting company awarded an $81 million contract this year to work on North Carolina's Hurricane Helene recovery, was recently barred from receiving government contracts in West Virginia for wanton indifference to public interest after prosecutors alleged that the company falsified applicant information and filed fake invoices while working for the federal government. (The company denied wrongdoing and settled.) Federal government auditors eventually found that, in Texas, after Hurricanes Dolly and Ike, disaster consultants were charging exorbitant rates for their services. In Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina, the government spent nearly $9 billion on contracts later understood to be plagued by waste, fraud, mismanagement, or abuse. Already, finding out what governments do with the money they get for disaster response is difficult, Madison Sloan, a lawyer who directs a disaster recovery project at Texas Appleseed, an advocacy organization, told me; she worries that adding in more contractors would make tracking spending impossible. Plus, unshackled from federal civil rights obligations, states may not work as hard to distribute assistance equitably, DeeDee Bennett Gayle, the chair of the University at Albany's emergency management department, told me. The challenges that existed before will likely increase. The Trump administration has done away, for example, with civil rights and fair housing obligations previously required for recipients of post disaster housing grants from a major HUD program. In the absence of such restrictions, some states are going to create rules that unfairly treat certain groups, Andrew Rumbach, a senior fellow at the nonprofit Urban Institute, told me. And however good their intentions, contractors will be working for the state. They don't have a public good mission. They're doing the work that they're contracted for, he said. Many emergency management experts do agree that more of the burden of disaster risk needs to shift back onto states; FEMA, as it stands now, is trying to do too much. How exactly the Trump administration will reform the agency is still unclear: Trump has said he will end FEMA, but his administration also recently announced it is getting the agency back on track. Its employees and former administrators beg to differ: Last week, just before the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina's landfall, almost 200 FEMA employees signed a letter warning Congress that the agency was at risk of another failure on the same order. Jennifer Forester, a FEMA employee who signed her name to the letter and was, along with her fellow signatories, subsequently put on leave, told me that, although private companies are part of the mix of disaster response, they are no replacement for government, which is not and should not be motivated by meeting a bottom line, she said. The president's FEMA review council is supposed to make recommendations about the agency's fate by November. FEMA's outsized role created a bloated bureaucracy that disincentivized state investment in their own resilience, the White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote in a statement; the review council's recommendations would help ensure the agency's work remains supplemental and appropriate to the scale of disaster. A FEMA spokesperson said in a statement that the council would strengthen how assistance is delivered. One very real possibility is that the country will simply spend less on disaster preparation and recovery in the years to come. Koon, the IEM executive, is hiring some departing FEMA folks, but told me uncertainty over how or whether the Trump administration will fund states' disaster recoveries has kept him from hiring more. Disasters will keep getting worse and more frequent, so there's plenty of work that will need to be done, he said. But without FEMA and other federal agencies to step in when their budgets fall short, state and local leaders will ask themselves whether they can afford to or whether they wish to offer the full suite of disaster work that the federal government once did. Financial assistance, housing assistance, and disaster care management may shrink, Koon said. So his contracts may too. At present, most states maintain a rainy day fund, but few have enough saved to manage a disaster. Small states can be overwhelmed by a disaster that leaves a few million dollars's worth of damage; Eric Forand, the director of Vermont's division of emergency management, told me that damage from flooding in 2023 ran to $600 million statewide. Floods have pummeled the state every summer since: This year, flooding in Sutton, home to fewer than 1,000 people, ran to 25 times the town's annual road budget, he said. The state has pre disaster agreements with some private contractors but, depending on what happens to FEMA, could need to lean on the private sector more. We can't increase and decrease the size of our permanent staff as disasters come and go, Forand said. As summer floods increase with climate change, Vermont has been working toward altering its budget so it can manage more of its smaller disasters on its own. But private contracting is expensive, and no matter how the state contorts itself, there will always be a place for FEMA and the federal government for large disasters, Forand told me. The cost and personnel demands of a major disaster will always far outstrip Vermont's capacity to pay for and staff one, as they would outstrip the capacity of many states. Disaster recovery in every state is already a long, hard, imperfect road. If FEMA stops stepping in after catastrophic events, Hiebert told me, I think you'd see a lot of places that would just never recover. Disaster contractors will undoubtedly step in more, but only as much as a state can pay."

    "content":"The Irish comedy writer Graham Linehan was once known for his charming, sometimes surreal sitcoms—Father Ted, Black Books, The IT Crowd—on British TV. These days, however, he is better known for his online crusade against transgender activism. His X feed takes the same approach as Libs of TikTok, cherry picking videos of criminals and fetishists in a full scale assault on gender ideology. He is obsessive and offensive. But is he a criminal? The British police seem to think so. Linehan was arrested by five armed officers today on his return from the United States, where he has been working on a new sitcom, and was accused of inciting violence. He says this allegation relates to three posts on X. (Authorities have not contradicted him, and British news outlets are treating his account as credible.) In one of the offending posts, he wrote: If a trans identified male is in a female only space, he is committing a violent, abusive act. Make a scene, call the cops, and if all else fails, punch him in the balls. Can criminal incitement really occur in a hypothetical situation? If so, we're going to need a bigger holding cell. Conor Friedersdorf: Europe's free speech problem Assuming that Linehan's account is correct, then his arrest is totalitarian, absurd, and a waste of police time. It is also symptomatic of a wider chill on free speech in Europe, where the selective deployment of laws over hate speech, offense, and incitement has turned the police into the enforcers of progressive values and given them enormous discretionary power. American readers will be used to conservatives claiming censorship at the slightest provocation, even as they enjoy the First Amendment's protection from government action. But the problem in Europe is real. In Munich this spring, Vice President J. D. Vance cited police action against a silent anti abortion protester in Britain as well as a man who burned a Quran in Sweden to make the case that, across Europe, free speech, I fear, is in retreat. Vance's position in the Trump administration gave skeptical audiences in Europe an excuse to ignore him. Given its illiberal treatment of anti Israel protesters and others, the White House has all the moral authority of a fox standing next to a heap of chicken bones. Many Europeans were familiar with Elon Musk's takeover of X, and so had seen firsthand what his version of a free speech absolutist world looks like in practice: a grim parade of snuff footage, violent anti Semitism, and monetized misinformation. Nonetheless, Vance was correct to say that parts of Europe have, with the good intention of protecting minorities, enacted extremely illiberal hate speech and harassment laws. The politicians who passed these laws did not seem to understand that highly disreputable people might try to use these measures to impose civil or criminal penalties on their critics and political opponents. In Germany, following the passage of gender self identification legislation last year, a male neo Nazi who claims to be a woman—although he's kept his handlebar moustache—has made vexatious complaints against newspapers that have publicly disbelieved the sincerity of his transition. Here in Britain, where I live, laws on malicious communication and public order mean the police regularly get dragged into soul sapping online scrums between obsessives who each accuse the other of hate speech and harassment. Huge amounts of time are wasted trying to untangle the truth. The chairman of the Scottish Police Federation, an officers' group, said last year that a deluge of hate crime reports, and authorities' pledge that every one would be investigated, has created a situation where we simply cannot cope. Helen Lewis: Britain rules on what a woman is Linehan has previously faced accusations that fall into this category, for which the best outcome would be if everyone involved logged off and got some fresh air. In May, a preliminary judgment found that he had defamed an actor with whom he was arguing online. In 2018, Linehan was given a police warning after a trans woman accused him of harassment for revealing her former male name online. (He countered that he had stepped in because she was harassing his friends.) Linehan was returning to Britain only because he faces trial on Thursday over another harassment allegation, this one following an altercation with an 18 year old trans woman. The deeper problem with European laws on speech and hate, however, is the widespread perception that they are selectively enforced. The most obvious example is the disproportionate prosecution of alleged hate crimes against police: In 2021, the BBC discovered that police officers and staff were the victims in up to half of the hate crimes charged in some areas, despite making up a tiny proportion of the overall number of recorded cases. (Back in 2006, local police in Oxford insisted on pursuing a case against a drunken student who called one of their horses gay.) In practice, hate speech laws give the police a weapon against people who have annoyed them. Overbroad legislation also gives the authorities the discretion to pursue disfavored groups and protect favored ones. In May this year, a man was convicted of a public order offense for burning a Quran—even though England repealed its blasphemy laws in 2008. Conservative campaigners argue that authorities tiptoe around Muslim sensibilities but ignore offenses against Christianity. Another cause clbre on the British right has been the case of Lucy Connolly, who posted a message—later deleted—during anti immigration riots last year, saying that she hoped someone burned down a hotel containing asylum seekers. She pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years and seven months in prison for publishing material that incited racial tensions, and is now presenting herself as a free speech martyr. Her post was offensive and inflammatory, but many people convicted of actual violent crimes receive lighter sentences. Cases like this create the perception of two tier justice, a charge that is regularly leveled against the government of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. (His spokesman today criticized Linehan's arrest.) Overzealous enforcement of speech laws creates a sense of grievance that the far right is primed to exploit. The debate over transgender inclusion demonstrates the double standard extremely well. Both trans activists and gender critical feminists, the latter of whom believe that people's biological sex rather than their self declared gender should be the basis of law and policy, have extremists in their ranks. And yet the police in Britain seem far more exercised about comments such as Linehan's than about equally violent rhetoric on the other side—including activism aimed at so called trans exclusionary radical feminists. In 2023, two Scottish politicians notoriously posed at a rally in front of a sign that said DECAPITATE TERFS. A police investigation was launched, but no action was taken. That same year, a trans activist named Sarah Jane Baker—who had previously been convicted of torturing a teenager, and then attempting to murder a fellow inmate while in prison—told a pro trans rally, If you see a TERF, punch them in the fucking face. A magistrate found Baker not guilty of encouraging violence, saying that Baker was not making a serious threat but wanted the publicity. Compare that case with Linehan's: If Baker was not convicted, why drag the comedy writer through the legal process for a less inflammatory remark? I don't want to downplay the fact that Linehan has a history of involvement in petty, grubby, and wearisome internet arguments. (And I say this as a frequent target of his rage.) But free speech martyrs are often like this: hard to sympathize with, or hard to defend. Open debate is often obnoxious, upsetting, or rude. But none of these adjectives should make it a police matter."

    "content":"Generative AI companies have established extraordinary influence over how people seek and access information. Chatbots, which confidently promise to answer any question and can generate images and videos remarkably quickly, are replacing traditional search engines and human experts as go to sources of knowledge. Yet their inputs—the data that determine how chatbots respond to their users—are secrets closely guarded by powerful companies that are fighting intensely with one another for AI dominance. The question of how, exactly, AI models are trained is hugely consequential—and not only because AI companies have trained their machines on an enormous number of copyrighted works without the consent of writers, musicians, podcasters, filmmakers, and others. (Many tech companies have been sued for doing this, and the legality of the practice remains an open question.) The works undergirding an AI's behavior may also include misinformation, conspiracy theories, and material that some people may find objectionable: racist text, pornographic media, step by step instructions for committing acts of violence, and so on. The Atlantic's goal in creating AI Watchdog is to open machine learning's black box. Understanding the future of technology—and the wild imagination, hubris, and upheaval that accompany every technological revolution—has been a preoccupation among Atlantic writers for generations. Vannevar Bush invented the hyperlink in our pages. And we were trying to train machines to write like humans long before ChatGPT existed. More recently, we published a groundbreaking investigation of Books3, a data set of nearly 200,000 copyrighted books that were used to train large language models. Since then, we've covered a much larger pirated book collection and shown that writing from movies and TV shows has also been used by AI companies without consent from writers. AI Watchdog expands these efforts with a search tool that allows you to see what material is included in various data sets—and which tech companies use that material to train their AI products. At launch, the tool includes more than 7.5 million books, 81 million research articles, 15 million YouTube videos, and writing from tens of thousands of movies and television shows. We will continue to add more data sets as we verify them. Most of the data sets in our collection were created by AI companies or research organizations and shared publicly on AI developer forums. If my work shows up in the search tool, was it definitely used to train AI? It's likely, but the appearance of a work in a data set is not definitive proof that a given company actually used that work. Any company may have decided to exclude any work when training their model. How do AI companies acquire content without paying for it? Sometimes AI companies pay to license content for training, but they also use a number of techniques to avoid paying: Books are usually acquired through pirated libraries on the web or via BitTorrent. Other media may be downloaded by broadly scraping the web, or by downloading existing scrapes of the web, such as Common Crawl. Search indexes such as Bing, Brave, and Google make full text articles available for use by AI companies. How can I prevent AI companies from using my work? The training data frenzy has been happening for several years, and many companies may have already used your work. However, tech firms are still constantly scraping the web for new material. There are things you can do that may help protect your work. If your work is visual, putting a watermark or logo on your images or videos will make them less attractive for AI training. Companies generally don't want to risk identifying individual creators; Stable Diffusion, for example, was sued after its image generator produced synthetic photos containing a Getty Images watermark. There are also AI poisoning systems, such as Nightshade and Glaze, which change images in ways that are invisible to humans but that may interfere with AI models' ability to learn from those images. Poisoned AI models may generate incoherent content. At least one poisoning system has also been developed for music. I believe my work was used by a specific company. What can I do about it? Individuals and institutions have brought dozens of lawsuits against AI companies for training their products with copyrighted books, articles, songs, videos, and art. Some of these lawsuits are class actions, meaning you might be entitled to damages if the plaintiffs win. (The Atlantic is a plaintiff in one such suit, against the AI start up Cohere.) The likelihood of receiving damages will be greater if your work is registered with the U.S. Copyright Office."

    "content":"Last week, a 23 year old opened fire outside a church at a Minneapolis Catholic school, killing two children and injuring 19 other people before dying by suicide. Just a few hours later, the shooter's YouTube videos began to circulate online. In one, the shooter shows off an arsenal of weapons and ammunition laid out on a bed. The killer laughs and offers a stream of consciousness monologue. I didn't ask for life, they say, the camera focused on the shooter's vape. You didn't ask for death. The video generated a lot of attention, in large part due to the images and phrases that the shooter had inscribed on guns and magazine cases: racial slurs, random expletives, and the names of at least 13 other killers. There were references to Waco and Ruby Ridge as well as BlackRock and ExxonMobil. One of the guns says Release the files! An ammo magazine is scrawled with kill Donald Trump; another says I'm the woker, baby, why so queerious. There are multiple references to memes: Popular phrases like skibidi appear, as does Lenny Face'(  )'and an extremely niche allusion to a web comic from 2008. Taken together, the messages are incoherent. This is irony poisoned nihilism, tactical gear as shitposting—the only cause this person seems to have is to troll the viewer. And it worked. The video was picked apart by people looking for some hints as to the shooter's motivation or politics. Some right wing influencers and MAGA friendly news outlets seized on the killer's gender identity, insinuating that the shooting had something to do with them being trans. Others fixated on the message about killing Trump and suggested the killer was a deranged liberal. Some left leaning commentators seized upon the anti Semitic scrawlings and racial slurs and said the killer was clearly a neo Nazi. But the rush to make sense of the shooting based on these messages and symbols is misguided. As incoherent, unhinged, or even cringey as the Minneapolis shooter's videos might seem, they are part of a familiar template of terroristic behavior—one that continues to spread in online communities dedicated to mass shootings and other forms of brutality. In these morbid spaces, killers are viewed as martyrs, and they're dubbed saints. Really, they're influencers. These disaffected communities live on social networks, message boards, and private Discords. They are populated by trolls, gore addicts, and, of course, aspiring shooters, who study, debate, and praise mass shooting tactics and manifestos. Frequently, these groups adopt the aesthetics of neo Nazis and white supremacists—sometimes because they are earnestly neo Nazis and white supremacists, and sometimes because it's the look and language that they're cribbing from elsewhere. It's always blurry, but it usually amounts to the same thing. In an article published by this magazine last year, Dave Cullen, author of the book Columbine, summed it all up: As you read this, a distraught, lonely kid somewhere is contemplating an attack—and the one community they trust is screaming, Do it! Dave Cullen: The Columbine killers fan club Authorities have not released information as to whether the Minneapolis shooter was active in these online communities. Still, the shooter did appear to be participating in what could only be described as a fandom: One of their guns contains a direct reference to the perpetrator of the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting. To understand the dynamics at play here, I spoke at length with Alex Newhouse, a researcher at the University of Colorado at Boulder who studies online extremism. He told me that the proximate goal of these attacks is to entrench the shooter in the broader legacy of violence and propel the legacy further. The idea, in other words, is to motivate someone else to become a shooter—by creating a public manifesto, leaving a trail of digital evidence, and even livestreaming attacks in some cases. The more frequently the template shows up, the more likely it will repeat, Newhouse said. It's not ideological in the sense that we tend to think about it. There may be anti Semitic or fascistic elements therein, but the real incentive is the self reinforcing legacy of these shooters. For that reason, Newhouse calls these groups mass shooter creation machines. There are many different networks of terror online, all with a constellation of differing ideologies, though many of them overlap. There is the Terrorgram Collective, whose leaders were last year indicted by the Department of Justice for soliciting hate crimes, soliciting the murder of federal officials, and conspiring to provide material support to terrorists. Another group is known as the True Crime Community, or TCC, which is a collection of users that grew in part out of the Columbiners community—these are fans of mass shooters and serial killers. Sometimes, these groups overlap with other violent networks, including those that traffic child pornography and target and exploit vulnerable minors into cutting or otherwise hurting themselves. As the extremism researchers Jean Slater and Ry Terran wrote earlier this year, these groups, as well as right wing youth subcultures, have blended together into a diffuse, hybrid threat network. What this means is that users from all these fringe subcultures—people from Terrorgram, mass murder fan groups, people looking to groom children, trolls—are interacting across public social networks and private chat communities. These individuals may not all share the same interests, yet they are fellow travelers on many of the worst spaces on the internet. Slater and Terran call this loose network the Soyjak Attacker Video Fandom, named in part after a message board started by 4chan users. This network, they write, is best understood as a fandom or subculture; it has no official membership or leaders. The fandom goes beyond simply admiring mass attackers, and is truly an active and participatory subculture. This is all meant to be impenetrable to outsiders, which is one reason for the confusion that follows shootings such as the one in Minneapolis. But the dynamics are familiar: There are in jokes, lore, and, most importantly, real people trying to impress their perceived peers. For instance, in January, the Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism and ProPublica reported that two teenagers who carried out separate shootings in Madison, Wisconsin (December 2024), and Nashville, Tennessee (January 2025), crossed paths online and frequented many of the same spaces dedicated to glorifying and discussing mass killings. The report notes that the Nashville killer praised the Madison shooter online as a saintress and boasted online that he used to be mutuals with someone who is now a real school shooter ; ). Again, all of this confounds traditional attempts at sense making. So much of the killers' legacy is built upon the dependability of individual shooters being treated as puzzles to solve and people to understand, Newhouse told me. The reaction—by the media, by researchers, by politicians—to dig into these individuals and sort it into something we can wrap our heads around is very human, but it helps sustain this cycle. The problem is not that media coverage or attempts at explanation necessarily glorifies the shooter, but that it directs attention toward the shooter. That people might be falling for the Minneapolis shooter's scribblings and raging at each other over potential motivations is likely thrilling to potential copycat killers—proof that the troll still works. We can link to the post still but summarize ourselves: As one extremism researcher posted last week, the goal of these attacks is to join the lineage of mass shooters and for the next killer to inscribe their name on a gun before an attack. What is chilling about this still novel brand of extremist violence is that it weaponizes one of the internet's greatest gifts: the ability for small groups of like minded people to find each other and build community. To counter this dynamic, Newhouse thinks lawmakers, those in charge of news coverage, and even interested onlookers should redirect attention away from individual perpetrators. Instead, they should focus on how mass shootings are a social problem driven by networks and communities. Addressing the problem would mean tackling the loneliness and alienation that cause people to seek out or fall into these online spaces. It would require real changes to firearm access. It would mean finding ways to counter the degradation of real, physical communities that lead people to retreat to the digital world, and it would mean expecting tech companies such as the infamously permissive Telegram to take a more active role in halting the recruitment of children into dangerous groups. There are no politically easy or fast solutions. But the situation is not hopeless. Near the end of our conversation, Newhouse offered an interesting comparison for the networked phenomenon of the modern, online mass shooter: ISIS. In 2015, Twitter began conducting mass deletion campaigns of suspected ISIS accounts, significantly disrupting the group's organizing and recruiting. When ISIS moved to more private networks, a group organized by Europol worked with nine technology platforms and service providers, including Telegram, to identify and suspend ISIS accounts and jihadist content. Eighty nine countries and institutions, including the United States, have joined a Global Coalition to fight ISIS, which continues to monitor digital activity and financial transactions to combat the terror group. There are signs throughout the last 20 years that you can disrupt well resourced established networks to make them less prolific, but it requires an extreme amount of government and corporate coordination, Newhouse said. As for the media, in the aftermath of the Minneapolis shooting, I went back and reread Columbine. I was haunted by the passages that chronicled the mass media's response to the shooting. In a rush to understand the tragedy and feed a hungry audience, their reporting helped spread rumors—that the killers were goths, that they targeted jocks and minorities, or that they were gay. Some of these mistruths portrayed the killers as outcasts and, crucially, victims. Others incorrectly stated that the killers had executed their plan to perfection. In reality, they botched their attack horribly. Their bombs never went off, and the pair died, according to Cullen, as miserable failures. But more than 26 years later, these mischaracterizations endured, becoming foundational lore for young people who want to follow in the killers' footsteps. The cycle that Columbine helped kick off has evolved into a subculture that is dark, unwieldy, and durable. Yes, it is an outgrowth of sick individuals, broken policy, and a nation brimming with firearms, but also of a culture that refuses to learn lessons from past tragedies. To break this nightmarish cycle, every bit of it has to change."

    "content":"This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here. The Trump administration broke the law. Its officials knew they were breaking the law. And they'll likely try to do so again. In its most distilled form, that's the conclusion of Charles Breyer, the federal judge overseeing a suit brought by California Governor Gavin Newsom over the Trump administration's deployment of National Guardsmen and Marines in and around Los Angeles in June. In a scathing opinion delivered today, Breyer said that the administration had acted illegally. Deploying these service members for the purpose of establishing a military presence there and enforcing federal law, Breyer wrote, is a serious violation of the Posse Comitatus Act. That law, passed in 1878, bars the use of the military in domestic law enforcement, except as allowed by the Constitution or by Congress. Breyer's ruling makes plain how the administration worked to circumvent the law, and why. In its public statements, the White House continues to claim that it's acting under long established authorities and engaging in straightforward, limited efforts to reduce street crime. The arguments that their lawyers made in court point to a different conclusion: The Trump administration is seeking martial law, in practice if not in name. Today's ruling might seem a bit obsolete—after all, the Marines and most of the Guardsmen have been sent home. But both Donald Trump and his critics have pointed to the deployment as a model, first for the current use of the National Guard in Washington, D.C., and now for potential deployments in cities including Chicago, San Francisco, and Baltimore. The people of the United States have been wary of the use of the military to enforce laws inside the country since even before the nation's founding; the presence of British troops was a spur to rebellion. The Constitution grants only Congress the right to call forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, although some delegates would have preferred not to allow that power at all. But it has been presidents who are more apt to use the military for law enforcement, and Congress has worked to limit their ability to do so over time. The president can call up troops under the Insurrection Act in certain circumstances, and Trump has toyed with invoking the law in the past, but he did not do so in California, nor did Congress authorize the deployment. (Trump also used his authority to federalize the California National Guard, over the objections of Newsom and local authorities who argued that the Guard wasn't needed to enforce laws.) The impact of these choices was well understood among the leadership at the military's Northern Command, which controlled the troops. Everyone in U.S. Northern Command knew that the Posse Comitatus Act applied, and no one expressed a contrary view, Breyer notes; its leaders instructed members of the Guard task force about what law enforcement duties they could not perform. Yet officials elsewhere in the federal government felt differently. Testimony from the trial established that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was closely involved in the operation, and that he issued a memo that purported to outline what administration officials described as a constitutional exception to the Posse Comitatus Act. The administration then used this exception to justify sending the Guard out to support missions that were plainly law enforcement actions—in places with no true risk of riots, some 50 and 140 miles from downtown Los Angeles. They were also involved in a sweep of MacArthur Park near downtown, called Operation Excalibur. As Breyer pointedly wrote in a footnote, Excalibur is, of course, a reference to the legendary sword of King Arthur, which symbolizes his divine sovereignty as king. When Major General Scott Sherman, a National Guard commander, West Point grad, and Iraq War veteran, cited objections to Guard involvement in an initial version of the operation, a Department of Homeland Security official responded by questioning Sherman's loyalty to the country. Breyer concluded that the memo was little more than an attempt to ignore the plain language of the law. The administration argued in court that a constitutional exception to the Posse Comitatus Act grants the president the authority to do anything he construes as protecting federal property, personnel, or functions. This assertion is not grounded in the history of the Act, Supreme Court jurisprudence on executive authority, or common sense, Breyer wrote. Today's ruling soundly rejects the Trump administration's reasoning, and it blocks further violations of the Posse Comitatus Act in California. (Breyer stayed his ruling until September 12.) It does not, however, apply nationwide. Although Trump seems to be treating the more widespread militarization of Washington as a test run for occupations of other cities, the legal arguments in California may be more relevant to those prospects, because Trump has narrower legal authority to act in other states than he does in the District of Columbia. Even if the stated goal is preventing street crime, the expansive views of presidential power raised in this case could allow a president to deploy the National Guard in scenarios that are clearly counter to Congress's intent, as well as outside of the force's training. Breyer notes, for example, that if presidents are allowed to use the Guard whenever federal law is impeded, they could do so for far fetched purposes such as enforcing tax laws or the Clean Water Act, or even to seize control over elections to prevent putative fraud. Perhaps that last one is not so far fetched: Trump aides considered using the military to grab voting machines as part of his attempt to subvert the 2020 presidential election that he lost. In June, my colleague David Frum laid out just how such a deployment could be one step in a successful bid to steal an election. Over the past few months, lower courts have repeatedly ruled against the Trump administration's attempts to assert new powers, only for appeals courts or the Supreme Court to side with the president. The government is expected to appeal this ruling, and it could end up discarded the same way. But Breyer's scolding provides an essential explanation of not only why Trump is overreaching but also why it is dangerous. Related: For Trump, this is a dress rehearsal, David Frum writes. What we lose by distorting the mission of the National Guard Here are three new stories from The Atlantic: The anti Trump strategy that's actually working The neighbor from hell, by Graeme Wood David Frum on how Trump gets his way Today's News D.C.

    "content":"In its period of exile, the Democratic Party has a lot of decisions to make. One of those decisions concerns its relationship with organized labor. Joe Biden and members of his administration—and, indeed, much of the party's leadership—believed that forming a historically tight partnership with organized labor would help arrest the party's decline with the working class. They turned out to be wrong. Working class voters, even the small and shrinking share of them who belong to private sector unions, continued drifting away, seemingly unimpressed by Union Joe's long list of policy concessions. Having seen their labor strategy collapse, Democrats are weighing two choices. One school of thought, favored on the progressive left, is that if Biden didn't win back working class voters, it's because he wasn't pro union enough. For example, a recent newsletter by Dan Pfeiffer, a former Obama administration official turned podcaster, argues that the path to winning back blue collar voters requires (among other things) that Democrats become even more pro union. Pfeiffer doesn't explain why a more ardent alliance with organized labor would succeed for future Democratic candidates when it failed for Biden, or even how exceeding Biden on this score would be possible. The necessity and utility of the maneuver is simply taken as axiomatic. A wiser strategy, one that a handful of Democrats have gingerly broached, would be to revert to the party's traditional, pre Biden stance toward labor. This approach would recognize that the political cost of trying to satisfy the labor movement's every demand is rising, and the number of votes that the movement delivers in return for such fealty is shrinking. The experience of the Biden administration, and of some Democratic run localities, suggests that automatic deference to unions can undermine what ought to be politicians' top priority right now: lowering the cost of living. Which means it is making the goal of winning back working class voters harder, not easier. The Democrats have been the pro labor party since the New Deal. But, before Biden, their alliance with labor was never unqualified. Democrats broadly supported laws that protected the right to organize, as well as the generous minimum wage and social insurance laws that unions favored. However, they made exceptions when they believed that union demands ran contrary to the public interest. Franklin D. Roosevelt himself sometimes intervened against striking unions, and even opposed public sector unionization on principle. Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy had episodic fights with labor even as they usually took its side. Bill Clinton broke with labor to enact the North American Free Trade Agreement. Barack Obama offended teachers' unions by supporting education reform, and defied some industrial unions by capping the tax break on expensive health insurance plans. Biden chose a different approach. He vowed to be the most pro union president leading the most pro union administration in American history. In practice, this meant not merely giving unions their customary seat at the table and vigorously enforcing labor law, as previous Democratic administrations had done, but exceeding that support in both symbolic and substantive ways. Biden called himself a union man, joined an auto worker picket line and, with rare exceptions, gave labor nearly absolute deference on any issue in which it held a direct stake. His administration directed $36 billion in federal spending to bail out the Teamsters' pension fund. Yet even before he abandoned his reelection bid, Biden's standing among working class voters was dismal. Once Kamala Harris replaced him as the nominee, she failed to garner an endorsement from the International Association of Fire Fighters, the International Longshoremen's Association, or the United Mine Workers of America—or even the Teamsters. Harris won a majority of union households, but according to Pew data, these voters swung toward Donald Trump by six points compared with 2016, in terms of two party vote share. Why did the administration's approach to unions fail to reap electoral rewards? One reason is that, as some union leaders have acknowledged, their members have begun basing their votes more on cultural issues, such as guns, immigration, and trans rights, than on economic ones. But there is another factor at play, one much less widely recognized: Uncritical fealty to union demands can cause Democrats to adopt policies that actually threaten working class voters' material well being. Michael Podhorzer: The paradox of the American labor movement Biden's long list of concessions to unions were not free. He kept in place tariffs Trump had imposed during his first term, raised them on Canadian lumber and solar panels from Southeast Asia, and made no effort to revive the Trans Pacific Partnership or any free trade agreement. He imposed more stringent rules favored by labor on domestic shipping and federal construction projects. None of these measures had a large effect individually. Collectively, they and others like them impeded Biden's goal of reopening the economy and then bringing down the inflation that followed. The potential for conflict between labor backed positions and the broader public good can sometimes sit in plain sight, unnoticed by unions or even third party observers. A recent New York Times story quotes a labor official in Nevada complaining that the Democratic Party alienated union members by failing to focus on affordability. The same article cites the union's complaints that Democratic legislators in the state voted in 2023 to end a requirement for daily hotel room cleanings. That requirement, adopted in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, was expensive and became obsolete once scientists realized that the virus did not, in fact, spread through surface contact. Amazingly, the union that backed the daily cleaning measure—and withheld support from Democrats who finally rescinded it three years later—is permitted in the article to pose as a champion of affordability, when it was fighting for a make work requirement that pushed up hotel costs. Labor's preferences were easier to align with Democratic policy goals in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Unemployment was high, the economy needed more stimulus, and policies that created more jobs were helpful in generating economic growth. (John Maynard Keynes famously argued during the Great Depression that hiring workers to dig holes and fill them again would still stimulate the economy.) But under the current conditions of low unemployment and elevated inflation, make work policies and excessive government spending are much more harmful. The rise of the abundance agenda, which focuses on removing barriers to providing Americans with a higher standard of living, especially by increasing the housing supply, has made the tension between these goals a subject of contentious debate on the left. This doesn't make the abundance agenda anti union. As Derek Thompson and Ezra Klein point out in Abundance, a book that otherwise mostly skirts the labor issue, countries with much higher union density than the United States have managed to build transportation infrastructure far more cheaply. Indeed, the paradigmatic case of abundance agenda liberalism in action, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's rapid rebuild of a collapsed I 95 bridge, was undertaken cooperatively with unions. The abundance agenda does, however, create more than occasional friction with union demands. Public employee unions support strict rules on compensation and firing that make it harder for the government to work as nimbly as the private sector. In California, where the housing shortage is especially dire, unions have used laws that hold up housing construction as leverage to extract concessions from developers. The California high speed rail authority, which is closing in on two decades of work without any usable track, continues to boast of the high paying jobs it has created. This reflects one side of a philosophical divide within the party over whether to treat high labor costs as a core goal of public infrastructure projects—or as, well, a cost. The abundance agenda thus implies that Democrats need to return to their pre Biden relationship with organized labor. This has generated intense backlash. At a high profile conference in April, the moderate commentator Josh Barro said, When I look at policies in New York that stand in the way of abundance, very often if you look under the hood, you eventually find a labor union at the end that's the driver. This comment, a video clip of which was promptly shared on X, was treated like an act of war by the online left. Bashing unions and calling for cutting wages and benefits will only lose us even more working class voters and elections, Greg Casar, a progressive Democratic House member from Texas, posted in response. Left wing magazines such as Jacobin, The Nation, and Current Affairs seized on Barro's comment as having exposed a barely concealed desire to crush labor. Jonathan Chait: The coming Democratic civil war The divide revealed by this episode is not about the general merit of unions, or about specific policy questions related to unions, but whether policy specifics need to be taken into account at all. The labor movement and its progressive allies treat support for labor as a binary question. To oppose any discrete union policy is to join the ranks of enemies of labor and therefore the progressive movement itself. That might sound like an unfairly broad characterization. But the polemics attacking the abundance agenda as anti labor are notable for their lack of substantive engagement. They treat even the most indefensible union demands as implicitly sacrosanct. One example is a requirement in New York City that subway trains employ two operators. In a column published first in Common Dreams, republished by In These Times, and republished yet again by Jacobin, Dylan Gyauch Lewis describes opposition to the two operator rule as prima facie evidence of abundance liberals' skepticism of labor. She does not bother to argue, or even assert, that this rule has any public safety (or other) value. Running through this line of argument is the idea that unions can do no wrong. Ro Khanna, a progressive representative from California who has praised aspects of the abundance agenda, recently told a meeting of the Teamsters,The problem is not with the Teamsters. The problem is with the Democratic Party. We can't expect people to vote if we don't stand for working class issues. Recall that the Teamsters declined to endorse Harris in 2024 even after the Biden administration bailed out its pension fund. If that doesn't count as standing up for working people, Biden must be wondering if he can have the $36 billion back to spend on something else. Campaigning and governing both involve trade offs. Democrats can and should defend the right to organize and support positions held by unions that don't impose a major drag on the public good. Winning the support of working class voters requires compromising with their views on social policy, which risks alienating other progressive groups. Making policy decisions sometimes presents a choice between the financial well being of an interest group, including unions, and the broader public. The Biden administration tried to inhabit a reality in which none of these choices existed. They could appeal to social liberals and compensate for their shortcomings with the working class by giving the unions a virtual veto over policy. The formula is so seductive that many Democrats still refuse to notice that it doesn't actually work."

    "content":"Every day, some 2 billion people around the world use privacy protection tools supported by the Open Technology Fund. When people in China escape their government's firewalls and censorship software—now so dense that the system has been called the locknet—or when users in Cuba or Myanmar evade cruder internet blocks, they can access material written in their own languages and read stories they would otherwise never see. Both the access and some of the information are available because the U.S. government has for decades backed a constellation of programs—the technology fund, independent foreign language broadcasters, counterpropaganda campaigns—designed to give people in repressive countries access to evidence based news. The information that people in the autocratic world receive from this network is wide ranging, based on reporting, and very different from what they are told by state media in their own country. If they live in Iran, for example, they might have learned from Radio Farda (backed by U.S. funding, broadcast in Persian) that their government did not, as it had claimed, capture an Israeli pilot during June's bombing campaign, and they might even have heard, in their own language, American explanations of the campaign instead. If they live in Siberia, they could hear from Radio Liberty (U.S. backed, staffed by Russian speaking journalists) precise information about the poor condition of their local roads, including one highway that is 89 miles long but so muddy and full of potholes that traversing it takes 36 hours. If they are Uyghurs living in China, they could have heard, at least before the end of May, reporting in Uyghur from Radio Free Asia (also U.S. backed, producing reports in nine languages), the broadcaster that originally informed the world about internment camps for members of the persecuted minority. Tom Nichols: They're cheering for Trump in Moscow—again But for how much longer will this information flow? Right now, all of America's foreign broadcasters, which also include Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, and a handful of others, are in grave danger. At the end of February, President Donald Trump appointed Kari Lake as senior adviser to the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees them. Lake is an ideologue and former local TV anchor who failed to be elected governor of Arizona, and then failed to be elected as a senator from Arizona. With no experience in international broadcasting or foreign policy, she put the entire staff of VOA on administrative leave and announced plans to cut the funding of all of the organizations under the USAGM umbrella; she did so with venomous relish, hypocritically accusing chronically underfunded broadcasters of wastefulness, tarring journalists as foreign agents. She began firing contract employees, in some cases giving visa holders who had worked for years on behalf of the U.S. government 30 days to leave the country. All of the organizations contend that Lake's actions are illegal, and all of them are now engaged in extensive lawsuits, even as they are already cutting budgets, programs, and journalists. They have won some initial cases. In March, U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth ordered the administration to keep Radio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty open, in keeping with Congress's longstanding determination that the continued operation of RFE\/RL is in the public interest. Last month, the same judge, a Ronald Reagan appointee, found that Lake did not actually have the right to fire Michael Abramowitz, the director of Voice of America. That power belongs to a bipartisan, Senate confirmed board—whose members Trump removed in January. Congress, not Lake, also has the legal right to decide whether or not to fund the broadcasters and can decide to do so, overriding the president and his Office of Management and Budget, which pushed hard to eliminate the outlets. Indeed, the House Appropriations Committee has already put funding for foreign broadcasting in next year's budget—although of course the administration is challenging Congress's power of the purse as well. Even if they remain open, all of the foreign broadcasters will remain in peril under an administration that is bent on destroying them, and they know it. When reporting this article, I interviewed multiple people who asked not to be quoted: Nobody wants to say or do anything that will make the situation worse. These are mission driven people who have gone to work every day in the belief that they are promoting America, as well as a set of American ideals—free speech, the rule of law, democracy. They have long had bipartisan support. Since the creation of Radio Free Europe in 1950, Democrats, Republicans, senators, representatives, and every president from Harry Truman to Joe Biden all believed in the importance of helping people in closed societies gain access to evidence based information, and not just for their own sake. Better informed Russians or Iranians would be less likely to go to war with us, less likely to invade other countries, more likely to resist the whims of their dictators. Even Donald Trump in his first term as president—despite the best efforts of some of his appointees—continued to support independent foreign media, anti censorship technology, and assistance for activists who fight censorship all over the world. But that era is over. Without openly saying so, the United States is reorienting its foreign policy to protect governments that manipulate and censor information, both inside their own countries and around the world. Our own national security could suffer. Promoting censorship is not how the administration describes its foreign policy, of course. In a speech in Riyadh earlier this year, Trump promised Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern monarchies that America would stop giving you lectures on how to live and how to govern your own affairs. That made it sound like the administration would be somehow neutral. But in a world of intense ideological competition, there is no such thing as neutrality. Since Trump's election, China has not stopped spending billions of dollars broadcasting autocratic propaganda, buying space on television networks around the world, and training international journalists. Russia has not stopped using social media and deceptive websites to weaken and divide the U.S. and Europe, to prop up dictatorships in Africa, or to lie about the war in Ukraine. Everywhere American voices disappear, other powers will fill the gap. An extensive Wall Street Journal investigation found that in Thailand, for example, a regular VOA slot on the Thai state broadcaster has already been replaced by a Chinese outlet. An Indonesian news channel that hosts a weekly program for the country's Chinese diaspora no longer features reports in Mandarin from VOA after the cuts; it has replaced them with China's state run television too. The Journal found that China is rushing to expand media services in Africa, and cited in particular Ethiopia and Nigeria; a former USAGM employee told me that this was happening just as U.S. broadcasters were planning to expand in Ethiopia. RFA's Cantonese language service went off the air July 1, on the anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong from the U.K. to China. The losses from cuts to RFE\/RL inside Russia will be just as great. Already, cuts to the outlet forced Systema, RFE\/RL's Russian investigative unit, to halt some of its work on corruption and organized crime, especially bad timing at a moment when this kind of information could help democratic governments track down companies that are evading sanctions. Programs exposing covert influence campaigns, counting war deaths, and producing material in minority languages aimed at Tatarstan, Bashkiria, and the North Caucasus have already been reduced or suspended. Russian state media will control the airwaves in all of those places instead. Read: The voice of America will sound like Trump In Iran, the impact could be even more acute. A few days after the Israeli and American bombing raids in Iran, I spoke with Saeid Golkar, a U.S. based political scientist who follows Iranian social media. He told me Iranians were hearing from the regime that we won this war; Israel has been defeated. Those who don't have access to alternative media were being bombarded with the same narrative: We are winning. At one point the Trump administration, belatedly realizing that it had a problem with messaging in Iran, scrambled to find recently sidelined Farsi speaking VOA journalists and asked them to come back to work. Americans have never supported foreign autocrats who hide information from citizens, nor did Trump's electorate vote for censorship. On the contrary, Trump's MAGA movement has repeatedly portrayed itself as the victim of censorship, sometimes conjuring up fake statistics or stories to prove it. (One famous example: that 22 million tweets were suppressed by the Biden administration during the 2020 presidential campaign, which would have been shocking had it actually happened). Yet now that they are in place, MAGA policies amount to unilateral disarmament in the ongoing narrative war between the autocratic and democratic worlds.. Rene DiResta: My encounter with the fantasy industrial complex Consider the fate of the Global Engagement Center, a small State Department office, also the product of a bipartisan effort and initially designed, well before the 2016 election, as a response to online terrorist and extremist campaigns. For the past several years, the GEC dedicated itself to identifying and revealing covert Russian and Chinese propaganda, most recently in Africa and Latin America. The GEC never played any role inside the United States and never aspired to do so. Nevertheless, the organization became the focus of a series of far right conspiracy theories, amplified on X, which dishonestly described the GEC as an institution promoting censorship. Late last year, congressional Republicans refused to renew its funding. When announcing the organization's final closure, the State Department declared that the GEC spent millions of dollars to actively silence and censor the voices of Americans—a statement that not only provided no evidence but also represented an extraordinary example of the department smearing its own employees. On Donald Trump Jr.'s podcast, Darren Beattie, the acting under secretary of state for public diplomacy and the person who shaped this policy, boasted about how he had killed off the GEC, a censorship operation within the State Department. In truth, the only real beneficiaries of the GEC's closure were the foreign dictators conducting covert propaganda campaigns. In the weeks before the organization ceased operations, employees were preparing an exposure of a Chinese information operation in Europe and other regions. Three people familiar with this plan, who requested anonymity to avoid jeopardizing current and former colleagues at the State Department, told me that it was presented to Beattie, who stopped work on the exposure. Far from spiking a single plan, we were proud to spike the entire GEC, Beattie said in a statement today. Indeed, not only was GEC's infamous censorship activity profoundly misaligned with this Administration's pro free speech position, it was woefully and embarrassingly ineffective on its own terms. We prefer to advance our public diplomacy objectives by telling the truth to our adversaries, rather than censor our own citizens. Beattie did not explain how exposing Chinese propaganda campaigns would restrict Americans' freedom of expression. Further consequences continue to reverberate. On August 29, the State Department leadership also gave official notice to staff that it was terminating more than two dozen agreements that the GEC had reached with countries around the world. These agreements had been designed to create common language and tactics to push back against Russian, Chinese, Iranian, and terrorist influence campaigns overseas. In the cable sent to staff, the State Department insisted that the agreements infringed upon free speech enshrined in the U.S. Constitution and stated that the best way to counter disinformation is free speech. But this is a strange argument to use in this context, given that the GEC was literally a vehicle for free speech: Its main function in the past several years was to publicly identify manipulation and promote transparency. Also, as one former State senior official pointed out to me, the department's arguments make no sense, given that the administration is seeking to dismantle America's foreign broadcasters. If we want more free speech, why are we suppressing our own voice? Even more mysterious, in this sense, are the assaults on the National Endowment for Democracy and its sister organizations, which include the International Republican Institute, affiliated with the Republican Party, and the National Democratic Institute, affiliated with the Democrats. These organizations were not, before November, of special concern to Trump. All of them were founded in 1983, inspired by Ronald Reagan's call for new institutions to foster the infrastructure of democracy—the system of a free press, unions, political parties, universities—which allows people to choose their own way, to develop their own culture, to reconcile their own differences through peaceful means. Until now they have also played important roles in countering authoritarian propaganda and fighting censorship around the world. NED makes small grants to groups that monitor elections, promote free speech, fight kleptocracy, and counter authoritarian propaganda. For example, NED once funded the Asia Fact Check Lab, which exposes and explains Chinese information operations. The IRI has among other things polled more than 1.5 million people in more than 100 countries in recent decades, helping provide reliable information about the public's views, often in places that don't have many other sources. The NDI's Open Government Partnership was one of many programs designed to fight corruption. The endowment has so far successfully fought attempts to cut its funding in court, winning an unambiguous legal ruling, with which the administration complied, to preserve in full this year's funding. NED also enjoys deep support across Congress, and has an organizational structure designed to protect it from political attack: It is run not by the U.S. government but by an independent, bipartisan board, which allows it to keep its distance from partisan politics. I was on that board from 2016 until 2024 and can attest that the conspiracy theories are wrong. The endowment's board members are not secret intelligence officers but former civil servants, members of Congress, academics, and regional experts. Nobody pays them for the work they do, pro bono, on NED's behalf. The same kinds of unpaid boards run NDI and IRI, organizations that have historically worked with center left and center right political parties around the world and played special roles in connecting members of Congress with their foreign counterparts—in other words, spreading the American message around the world. Both have deep links to their respective parties; notably, the IRI board includes Senators Mitt Romney, Lindsey Graham, Joni Ernst, Tom Cotton, and Dan Sullivan. And yet all of these organizations also became targets after a small number of accounts on X began attacking them. (One of the accounts belongs to Mike Benz, who also invented the Biden censored 22 million tweets mythology, so there is a certain logic to his role.) Among other things, the accounts falsely accuse the organizations of being CIA fronts—exactly the kind of lie that Russian propagandists tell. None of these organizations, and certainly not the foreign broadcasters, has ever been offered a good faith explanation for why they continue to be monitored, audited, and threatened with closure. The only kind of communication we've gotten from USAGM, even at a staff level, is around terminations and reactivation of our grant agreement, one agency insider told me on the condition of anonymity. There's no engagement on the work or the substance or the capabilities of the organization whatsoever. Yet the work has never been more urgent. In the areas of censorship technology alone, cuts could begin to have immediate impact if not reversed. If funding for their virtual private network initiatives is not renewed, for example, the OTF will have to cut off access for tens of millions of users in China, Russia, Cuba, and Iran next November. Chinese and Russian propagandists aren't hiding how pleased they are by cuts to the organizations that challenge them and their narratives all over the world. Hu Xijin, the former editor of Global Times, a Chinese state backed publication, wrote on social media that the Chinese people are happy to see the U.S. anti China ideological fortress breached from within. Margarita Simonyan, the editor in chief of RT, the Russian state news station, echoed this view on a Russian talk show: Today is a holiday for me and my colleagues at RT and Sputnik, she said soon after cuts to RFE\/RL and VOA were announced. The show's host responded by gloating about fired Russian employees who will now fight for the right to work as cleaners and floor cleaners. The host continued, By the way, I am addressing you, independent journalists: Die, you animals, because you are lying, vile, disgusting traitors to the Motherland. Die in a ditch. From the June 2024 issue: The new propaganda war Lying, vile, disgusting traitors to the Motherland—the extremity of this language is a clue to why these organizations matter. Officials in Russia, China, Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, and other dictatorships hate independent journalism and civic engagement for good reasons. Real information exposes crime and corruption. Active citizens inspire people to hope for something better. Inside Russia, they could help convince the public that the war in Ukraine is a shocking waste of human life. Inside Iran, they could inspire people to fight against a regime that's destroying their economy and carrying out a paranoid search for political enemies. More than 800 executions have already taken place this year, a huge increase over last year's pace. From the American point of view, foreign broadcasters and organizations that fight foreign propaganda are a bargain. They cost very little in comparison with the billions we spend on defense. They have the potential to produce huge benefits. So why cut them? In the absence of logical explanations, alternate theories abound. Some believe there is a plan to privatize VOA. Others think the explanation is simpler. Some MAGA acolytes, including Russell Vought of OMB, simply don't believe that the U.S. should have any kind of soft power. Others like and admire Russian President Vladimir Putin's regime. In December 2021, for example, Darren Beattie posted on X that Nato is a much greater threat to American liberty than Putin ever was. Perhaps Beattie, Lake, and Benz simply share the same deep dislike of independent journalists such as Hu Xijin and Margarita Simonyan, and feel the same enthusiasm for destroying them. The Trump administration has temporarily given this clique power. But even now, it is important to remember that they don't represent the majority of Americans, nor do they represent a majority in Congress. In the coming months, the House and the Senate can, with a little effort and just the barest hint of bravery, resist this unilateral disarmament and put America back at the center of the fight against authoritarian propaganda. Instead of allowing the Chinese and Russians to gain ground, Congress can both restore funding and push back against the administration's budgetary games, the rescissions that could restrict Congress's ability to legislate about this, or anything else, in the future. They can also back the people and the programs that legislators, including Republicans in both chambers, have long said they believe in. As Judge Lamberth wrote, when ruling on the case of RFE\/RL, Congress has found that it is the policy of the United States to promote the right of freedom of opinion and expression' and that open communication of information and ideas among the peoples of the world contributes to international peace and stability. Following its own logic, Congress can rededicate America to the real fight, against real censorship, once again. *Illustration Sources: Jorg Greuel \/ Getty; CSA Archive \/ Getty; Colors Hunter \/ Getty; Talaj \/ Getty."

D. Vance presidency might mean for the country. He contrasts Trump's impulsive, ego driven style with Vance's methodical, ideologically driven approach, examining how each wields power, pursues personal and political goals, and shapes domestic and foreign policy. Frum explains why understanding these differences is crucial for anticipating the challenges ahead. Then Frum is joined by Jonathan Rauch, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author of The Constitution of Knowledge: A Defense of Truth. They discuss how societies decide what's real, why disinformation has become a central political strategy, and living in a reality based community. Rauch explains the dangers of the fire hose of falsehood, why authoritarian regimes weaponize confusion, and why, even amid today's machinery of lies, reality still has the final word. The following is a transcript of the episode: David Frum: Hello, and welcome back to The David Frum Show. I'm David Frum, a staff writer at The Atlantic. My guest this week will be Jonathan Rauch of the Brookings Institution and The Atlantic, and we'll be talking about many things, but above all about his landmark 2021 book, The Constitution of Knowledge. Before I talk to Jonathan, I want to open with some preliminary remarks about a shadowy future ahead for the United States. I am recording this talk on the 1st of September of 2025, Labor Day Monday. Now, rumor is rife this day that President [Donald] Trump suffered some kind of medical event over the weekend. I have, of course, no idea whether there is any basis for this rumor, and I'm not speculating about its truth or falsehood. But here are some hard facts. When Donald Trump entered office in January 2025, he was five months older than Joe Biden was when Joe Biden started his presidency in January of 2021. Watch any video of Trump, compare it to a video even from his first term, when he was already past 70, and you can see the evidence of time upon his body and mind. Now, there are more than 40 months remaining in the present Trump term. It's worth preparing now for what may lie ahead—preparing intellectually, I mean, for what may lie ahead—and specifically for the ways that an administration might change or this administration might change if Vice President [J. D.] Vance inherited President Trump's office either before 2028 or after. Now, I often use the following formula to describe the Donald Trump personality and the Donald Trump presidency. I've said he's a head case first, a crook second, and an autocrat only third. Trump's peculiar psychology often impels him to do things that are nonfunctional from any other point of view. One example: President Trump in his first term received a lot of political benefit from his close political association, his close working relationship, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Now in September of 2025, Trump is locked in a bitter personal dispute with Modi that has blown up a 30 year strategic partnership between India and the United States, and it's reportedly all because Trump is furious at Modi for not nominating Donald Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize for Donald Trump's very minor role in brokering an end to the India Pakistan fighting in June of 2025. The annals of the Trump presidency—first term and second—are thick with incidents that make no sense even on Donald Trump's own terms. I mean, think about the story about the Qatari plane that Donald Trump has purported to accept on behalf of the United States and that is supposedly then going to be donated to the Trump presidential library, whether on the ground or in the air, after Donald Trump leaves office. Now, this so called gift is going to cost the American taxpayer a billion dollars. It can be refused by any future Congress because a president or a person—anyone who's an official—can only accept a gift from a foreign government with the consent of Congress, and if Congress were to pass a resolution saying the gift is not acceptable, then the gift would become illegal and unconstitutional. Now, why go through all of this for such a speculative benefit? I think it's driven by psychological need more than any kind of rational desire for gain. Now, if we imagine a President Vance, I expect we'll see less of this kind of self defeating behavior. Through his political life, Vance has pursued power fiercely, but astutely. He has reinvented himself again and again as opportunity beckoned, but he does not get distracted by delusions and fantasies the way Donald Trump has so often done. So he's not a head case, nor is Vance the kind of impulse driven pursuer of personal financial gain that Donald Trump is. I don't mean that a Vance administration would be an honest one. Vance is very much beholden to and often deeply identifies with men who seem to wish to use the United States government as a tool for their own massive self enrichment. But I don't see Vance engaging in the kind of petty chicanery, like making the Secret Service stay at a resort or hotel that Vance owns and then overcharging from their night in order to make a few comparatively paltry dollars. I don't see him doing things like that, in that kind of self defeating way. There's no Vance meme coin, and there's no instance of Vance putting his relatives into positions to pick up special favors and advantages the way some of Donald Trump's relatives have done. That kind of thing is not the Vance style. But what is ahead for a Vance presidency—whether before or after 2028—is for a leader determined to consolidate power, other people's greed can often offer a useful tool. [Russian President] Vladimir Putin skyrocketed to power in the year 2000 by offering protection to the family and friends of the dying Russian President Boris Yeltsin. If they supported the maneuvers that brought Putin to the presidency, without a prior election, Putin would secure their wealth and privileges against the family's loss of its grip on power and public office. The story is told in the book from Yale University Press, with the wonderful title The Less You Know, the Better You Sleep, by veteran Russia correspondent David Satter. You might imagine some kind of comparable or analogous deal being struck between an incoming President Vance and suddenly vulnerable members of the 47th president's family. Unlike Trump, J. D. Vance has a lot of ideas about the external world that go far beyond his own vanity and his own wealth. Trump likes Putin and hates Ukraine because, apparently, Putin flatters him and because Ukraine defied or insulted him. Vance thinks much more ideologically. He fits both Ukraine and Russia into a much larger project to promote extremist right wing rule across the European continent. He traveled to Germany in February to help that country's far right in elections that same month. Then he spent his summer holidays in England to boost authoritarian nationalists over moderate conservatives. Trump likes tariffs because he wrongly thinks foreigners are taking advantage of Americans and because maybe he enjoys the emotional surge of wielding arbitrary power. Did I say 25 percent tariffs? I'm doubling them and now I'm doubling them again. Oh, you said something nice to me. Okay, back to 25 percent. He loves that. Vance advocates tariffs, however, for much more grounded reasons. He has a vision of transforming the United States economy in such a way as to up value the comparative—the relative value of male labor, devalue the relative value of female labor, and thereby make marginal men more attractive as partners in a big social engineering project that is not ultimately economic, but that, it's not just whimsical; it is part of a larger vision of how things should be, how the world should be. It's an ideology, not a fixation, and not a twitch—something carefully considered. Where Vance is continuous with Trump is in his preference for, or in his attraction to, or his willingness to use authoritarian methods of governance. Vance has made himself the face of Trump's military deployments in Democratic governed cities—Los Angeles and Washington, for now; Chicago, apparently, next; maybe others in the future. Vance mimics and even outdoes Trump's derisive and sarcastic rhetorical style that denies dignity and respect to opponents and critics. Trump has taken every side of the immigration debate over his career. He can flip flop even on admitting hundreds of thousands of Chinese foreign students in the United States. One day, No. The next day, Yes. The day after that: Who knows? For Vance, it's a matter of supreme principle to purge the country of unwanted foreigners by any means necessary, including the suppression of previously existing due process, which he's defended in writing, for example, in this quote, from a tweet of April 15th this year. Here's Vance: Here's a useful test: ask the people weeping over the lack of due process what precisely they propose for dealing with Biden's millions and millions of illegals. And with reasonable resource and administrative judge constraints, does their solution allow us to deport at least a few million people per year? So since the goal is to deport a few million people per year, we have to do away with due process because there's no way to achieve that goal while respecting due process, and even though due process is in the Constitution, out it goes. And that's not a whim, and that's not a twitch. That's a matter of settled and sincere belief for which Vance is willing to pay a political price. It's important to understand, as we consider what may lie ahead between now and 2028 and after 2028, that not all authoritarians are the same. Some are flamboyant and bombastic. Others are methodical and purposeful. Some talk a lot. Others talk less. Some are motivated by personal ego, others, by ideological fanaticism. Some are driven by past vendettas, others, by plans to grab power and never let it go. Some are the past, and others are the future. Had Donald Trump vanished from politics after the attempted coup of January 2021, Americans might congratulate themselves on surviving a bad episode in their country's history as they survived the repressive panic after the First World War and McCarthyism after the Second World War. But Trump did not vanish. He returned to power, this time backed by a party and a movement united in support of his authoritarian goals and authoritarian methods. The American crisis of democracy is shaping up to be bigger than any one person, even a person as outsize as Donald Trump. The crisis will not end when Trump's career does. The crisis may, in fact, be getting bigger, more dangerous, more institutional, more permanent. A crisis of the house divided as grave or graver than any since the Civil War. And now my dialogue with Jonathan Rauch. But first, a quick break. [Music] David Frum: Jonathan Rauch is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute and a contributing editor to The Atlantic. Those titles, however, don't convey the weight of the reputation Jonathan has earned in 45 years in journalism. He has won esteem and admiration through the English speaking world, with books and articles on subjects from gay marriage to nuclear power to modern Japanese life. Looming over all those accomplishments, however, is his most recent book, The Constitution of Knowledge. The Constitution of Knowledge is a work of philosophy about the subject of how we know and how we're entitled to say that we know. And in my opinion, it belongs on the shelf with [Ren] Descartes, [John] Locke, and all the other great thinkers on these important questions of the way the human mind works. I've known Jonathan Rauch personally as a close friend since 1978, and although I've seen him acclaimed over those years for many achievements, The Constitution of Knowledge is his greatest, and the topic of our conversation today. Jonathan, welcome. And I'm about to lower the tone dramatically. Jonathan Rauch: Well, go ahead, but I just have to thank you for that outrageously overgenerous introduction. None of those accomplishments really matches up to the value of my friendship with you, David. You've been my spirit animal for almost 50 years. Frum: Well, thank you. But now I'm going to lower the tone, so you may want to retract that remark. So I discovered before we talked that you had not heard of the story I'm about to say, so I'm going to tell it in a little bit more detail, but you don't need to know the details to see how I'm going to queue it up because what I want to know is, how does an adherent of The Constitution of Knowledge deal with the following problem? There is a well known podcaster named Candace Owens. Huge, huge following. Says a lot of weird things, a lot of crazy things, a lot of borderline, or even over the borderline, anti Semitic things. But she's in serious legal trouble right now because a lawsuit has been filed over her repeated, multipart accusations and claims that the wife of the president of France, a mother of three children, has in fact been a man all along and was born a man, in Candace Owens's words, and will die a man. Now, I'm not asking you to enter into the Owens Macron controversy or to comment in any way. Rauch: Oh, c—mon, can't I really? Frum: I want to know, how do you, Jonathan Rauch, leading exponent of the constitution of knowledge—how do you deal with a problem like this? Rauch: (Laughs.) Well, first of all, I laugh. Second of all, I remind us that in a libel lawsuit, truth is an absolute defense. The third thing to say is, so what we're looking at here could be just hilarious and amusing, or it could be quite sinister, depending on the context. It's hilarious and amusing if it's a tabloid story in which crazy people out for clicks say crazy things, and that's their business model, and get sued for it. It is more sinister if it's part of an entire information ecosystem that is in the business of spreading lies, exaggerations, half truths, and conspiracy theories for political gain. And sometimes those things will be funny and outrageous. Sometimes they'll seem funny and outrageous like Hillary Clinton is running a juvenile sex trafficking ring from the basement of a pizzeria, but they'll turn out not to be funny when some guy shows up with a rifle and starts shooting. And sometimes they'll be deeply sinister, as when they're integrated into a campaign being run by the president of the United States and his federal government. So you tell me, is Candace Owens part of a larger industrial complex devoted to lying in politics, or is this a hilarious one off? Frum: You tell me. Rauch: Well, okay, let's set aside Candace Owens. Let's go a little bit closer to the bone. In Donald Trump's first term, he engaged in something that's known in disinformation circles—we can talk about what that is and what it isn't in the constitution of knowledge; we'll get there in a minute, I guess—but he engaged in what's known as a fire hose of falsehood, Russian style, mass disinformation campaign, and that's where you put out so many lies, exaggerations, half truths, and conspiracy theories that people just throw up their hands. The media can't keep up. No one knows what's right or wrong. The fact checkers can't keep up. Twenty a day is how The Washington Post clocked his lies. You don't do that by accident. You do that on purpose. The second term looks a little bit different. Again, you tell me if it's more sinister or less. I suspect it's more sinister. In the first term we were seeing mountains of lies emanating from the mouth of Donald Trump, but we were not seeing mountains of lies emanating from the entire administration below him. We were seeing a lot of bureaucracies, places like, you know, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, doing their best to hang on to truth telling. In the second term, we're seeing cabinet officials—people like the attorney general and people like the secretary of Health and Human Services—we're seeing official agencies all engaging in this same practice. And so now we're seeing a machinery of lies. It's coming from the government itself, not just Trump. That's a change, and it's a bad change. So does that answer the question? Frum: Well, let me give you a concrete example, another concrete example. And this one is clearly not funny, not even a little bit. You're the parent of a newborn child and you want to do the best for your child. And the doctor recommends to you that you go through a suite of vaccinations for the child. But you've heard one of your neighbors say that this is not a good idea, that the vaccinations will actually harm your child, whom you love more than anything. And so you go online to find out what the truth is, and maybe you go to government agencies, which are the most reputable, and you discover the government agencies, who used to be sure that you should do the suite of vaccinations, are suddenly endorsing the view that it's complicated. You can't be sure. There are a lot of risks here. You need to balance them for yourself using information from somebody other than the government itself. Where are we on that? Rauch: We're in a dangerous place. Or what if you're concerned about foreign policy and you're trying to understand what America's stakes are in, for example, the fight over Ukraine, and the president tells you that this was a fight that the Ukrainians started. The complete inversion of reality. You're apt to be confused, right? Frum: Yeah. Rauch: And that's the point. Frum: So what is this constitution that we are supposed to follow as our guide to solving this problem? Rauch: Well, this might take a second because it's an entire book in a nutshell, but I'll try not to filibuster. Every society from a small tribe to a large country has a problem with reality, which is people perceive reality differently and they get in fights over it. What's true; what's not true? In a small tribe, on something that's got pretty much instantaneous feedback, like, Where is the next water hole? or, Where's the enemy tribe located? Are they over the next hill? or, Is that a tiger in the bush?'you're going to get quick feedback and you're going to be fairly reality based. But on the bigger, more abstract questions—which a lot can depend on—like Which God do we worship to make it rain?, you're going to disagree. Down through the ages, societies have mostly settled that question through violence, war, oppression. They rely on an authoritarian leader, a priest, an oracle—terrible, terrible ways to stay grounded to reality. Starting in the time of John Locke and Galileo—and then in the 300 some years since then—we in the liberal West developed an alternative. I call it the constitution of knowledge, but it is a set of rules and norms and institutions that dictate how we go about settling our disagreements about reality and that show us a way to do that that keeps us grounded in reality and that allows us to settle our disagreements peaceably through structured persuasion. And what it does is—we call this science, but it's broader than science; it also includes journalism and law and government agencies, and museums and libraries—but it creates an international system in which people follow rules to float hypotheses and refute those hypotheses and get trained up in how to do that. They're not allowed to use coercion. They're not allowed to end arguments. They're forced to defend themselves. There's a lot of structure that goes into that. If you just throw people in a room and say, Disagree. Come up with an idea of truth, you get 8chan, 4chan, X. You need tons of structure to make it happen. And that's the constitution of knowledge. It's all of these institutions and norms: everything from the academic journals to the legal standards, which you learned at Harvard Law School. How to write a footnote, how to structure an argument, publication standards, all of this stuff. And it defines what I call the reality based community, of which the four long poles are: the world of academics, research, and science, number one; journalism, number two; law, number three; and government, number four. Government has to be tethered to reality, or it can just throw you in jail for a made up crime, which, by the way, seems to be happening, at least to some people. So that's the constitution of knowledge in a nutshell. It's the system we rely on to keep our society tethered to reality in a way that is peaceful and knowledgeable, preserves our freedom—and that's what's under attack. And by the way, has been since Galileo's time. Frum: So some parts of this constitution of knowledge look more robust than others. So, when the president of France and his wife come to court and present their case against Candace Owens and demonstrate the DNA hearings and show the biological relationship of Brigitte Macron to her three children, they will prove that they are right, that Candace Owens was repeatedly and deliberately and intentionally mistaken, and she will probably owe some money, if she doesn't settle first. So that part of the constitutional community will work. But to go to my example about the vaccinations: If you are a young parent trying to find out whether to vaccinate your child, the governmental part of that community is suddenly a lot less helpful than it was a year and a half ago. Rauch: Well, that's right. People don't think about this, David, but over a period of decades, a lot of systems were put in place to try to keep the U.S. government reality based, and that's very important for a bunch of reasons. One is, you'll make bad choices as a government if your choices are not based on reality. You'll vaccinate the wrong people. You won't vaccinate anyone. You'll fail to approve the drugs that should be approved. You'll get into wars and conflicts. You shouldn't—on and on and on. The second reason that we did that is basic fairness and justice, right? If government can make up facts about you, then it can do anything it wants to. This is what we learned from [George] Orwell and [Hannah] Arendt. The core of totalitarianism is the government's ability to make stuff up. So we adopted things like the Administrative Procedure Act in the '40s, and that sets up pretty elaborate systems that keep government tethered to facts. We put inspectors general throughout the government, dozens of them in multiple agencies with independence to say, Okay, is the decision making here lawful and is it factual? We delegated courts so that if the government bases its regulatory decision on false facts, you can go to court; you can sue. You can say, This is false, and a court will find for you, and on and on and on. This is one of the great achievements of the modern liberal state. Fact basing. We now see an attack on that on multiple fronts. Think about DOGE. A bunch of amateurs are put in charge of reforming everything. They sweep in there and then they start putting up a website, trumpeting their claims, many of which turn out to be simply made up. They exaggerate their savings by an order of magnitude. What you do with this is you quickly put in position two things. First, people don't know what they can rely on, on something fundamental like vaccines or something like foreign policy. But second, after a while, you get to the real goal of this kind of campaign of untruth and disinformation. People throw up their hands. They say, I don't know who to believe anymore. The New York Times is saying one thing, but the secretary of Health and Human Services is saying another. Is it safe to take this vaccine? Isn't it safe? They throw up their hands and they stop believing in any facts at all. Once you've done that, you've demoralized your target population. You've made them feel it's futile to fight back, to ever decide on truth. And that's the ultimate goal. Frum: Tell me about the other poles. I think there's a lot of feeling in American society now that universities are not doing their job of being objective, fact driven institutions of learning, but are adopting ideological missions of one kind, and now there's this big counterreaction to push them to be ideological in a different way. Can the system work with one pole missing, or do we need all four to be working it together at the same time for the system to function? Rauch: Well, of course, ideally, you want them all to be in good shape. Until January 20th, 2025, I was most worried about universities. Despite Trump's attempt in the first term to warp the government scientific agencies, he mostly failed at doing that. Media has its problems, but it, I think, acquitted itself with flying colors in Trump's first term. And indeed with some flaws in Biden's term, in telling us what's going on in the government—could be better, of course. Courts did best of all. Academia was, I think, the most problematic area for all the reasons that you've just mentioned. One is there are fields now, the humanities and social sciences, where you see politicization, and even where you don't see deliberate politicization, you see such an overwhelming ratio of progressives to all other points of view, that there's no longer enough robust disagreement for views to really be tested. So things that just aren't true begin to get promulgated. I've been worried enough about that to join the board of Heterodox Academy, which is an academic reform organization and to join the advisory board of University of Austin, which is trying to set out a new direction and to really work on reforming this problem. Trust in universities has dropped by, what, 20 percentage points, over the last five years, something pretty catastrophic, and that's gotta be fixed because universities—you know, if there's going to be a cure for cancer, it's probably going to come out of our universities, out of our research establishment. And when it gets corrupted, a lot of bad things happen. That's true until January 19th, 2025. And now I think we have a bigger problem, which is that the U.S. government itself is under siege. Frum: All right, so as a citizen of the society governed by the constitution of knowledge, what are your rights and what are your responsibilities? Rauch: So let me see if I can answer this in a slightly larger context. Rights and responsibilities is the correct frame. We talk endlessly about freedom of speech, for example, in academia, and academic freedom. Freedom is easy to talk about. But there are three things that you need for the constitution of knowledge to work, and you've got to have all three of them. And all three of them are difficult. The first is freedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedom of inquiry. And that means on university campuses, when you've got two thirds of students saying that they feel chilled, reluctant to express their true opinions for fear of social consequences, that's a big problem. When professors are saying they're afraid to speak out, that's a big problem. So you've got to have freedom of speech, but we're used to talking about that. But you need two other things. The second is commitment to fact. The rule of fact in the constitution of knowledge is like the rule of law in the U.S. Constitution. Even when you don't like how it comes out, even when you think it's wrong, in the end, you accept the consensus on facts. You can challenge it. You can change it over time, but you don't make up your own facts. You don't invent footnotes. You don't say any old thing. You abide by the rule of fact, and that is really hard to do. It's way easier and more fun to make stuff up or a conspiracy theory or whatnot. But without that adherence to the rule of facts, we're nowhere. So you need discipline, not just freedom. That's the responsibility that goes with the right. And then the third thing you need is diversity of viewpoint. This is a direct analogy to Madison's enlarge the sphere, the need for pluralism to make constitutional democracy work. How do you deal with the problem of one faction becoming powerful and taking control? You have a lot of factions and you pit them against each other. Same thing with the constitution of knowledge. You have to have a lot of different viewpoints and a lot of different people defending those viewpoints because we can't see our own biases, but I can see some of yours and you can see some of mine. So we pit these viewpoints against each other, and that's the magic of the whole system. That's how we find our errors. If you don't have viewpoint diversity, if, for instance, everybody in the sociology department believes—well, we won't get into specifics, I can think of a few things—but believes the same thing on race or sex or gender, those assumptions won't be questioned and mistakes will be made. So you've got to have all three of those things and they're all in jeopardy. Frum: What about taboos? Where do they fit into the constitution of knowledge? Let me give you a very concrete example from the history of religion. There has been a long, long debate about whether Jesus was an historical person, whether he existed, and whether the Gospel version of his life is true. Many different points of view have been aired on that. And we have long ago stopped murdering people if they say something that one faction or another doesn't agree. In the history of Judaism, are stories like the Exodus from Egypt true? Is a story of the conquest of the Holy Land by Joshua true? Again, a lot of research, a lot of archaeology on those questions. Islam makes a series of historical claims about itself, and you can't study those and the few in academic institutions that have ever studied them do so in a code so deliberately impenetrable as to make its books unreadable by outsiders. And the reason they do is because everyone understands that, like Christianity before, I don't know, 1789, unlike the history of Judaism, because Jews never had this power, you give the wrong answer to the question and you could be faced with deadly violence and probably the authorities will look the other way. Rauch: Well, it depends what you mean by taboo, right? If you mean a social taboo, things that we think it's just better not to talk about generally, like, what's the evidence on race and IQ? You know, sometimes I'm okay with that. We don't start from scratch in the reality based community. We don't get up every morning and try to say, Is the law of gravity still true today? Is evolution still true? Do we decide today to restudy the Holocaust? The answer is we don't need to. Ideally you wouldn't have things become cemented in taboos where you can't question them at all, but very often we consign people who question established truth and facts and sometimes taboos to the margins. And usually they belong there because usually they're nut cases, but not always. Okay. But terrorism, violence, outright threats and intimidation have no place in this system. Of course, one of the first examples of using terrorism internationally to suppress an entire conversation was the stimulus for my first and maybe still most important book, Kindly Inquisitors: The New Attacks on Free Thought, and that was in February of 1989 when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini decreed the death of Salman Rushdie for writing a novel. Now, it wasn't just about the novel, it was really about the ideas in the novel, and it was about the idea that anyone anywhere in the world could question the truths that the Ayatollah maintained. And that proved to be an effective campaign. A bunch of people were killed and a lot of other people were chilled. And that campaign is still going on. I was just two weeks ago giving a talk on the exact same stage where Salman Rushdie, a few years ago, was almost murdered by a knife ist. I actually met the guy who was the first to rush the stage and get that guy. Of course, this kind of violence, this kind of threat, has no place in the constitution of knowledge, and the whole point of the constitution of knowledge is it forces us, whether we want to or not, to settle our disagreements through persuasion. The very first thing it does—like the U.S. Constitution—is take violence out of the hands of ordinary people and say, That's not how we settle disputes. Frum: What happens when the authorities become selective in the extent to which they will deal with violence and not deal with violence? I mean, since October 7th of 2023, we have seen that, in the United States to a lesser degree, in Canada to a greater degree, in Europe and the United Kingdom even more, there's certain forms of violence and intimidation that the authorities will look away from, perhaps because they're frightened, perhaps because important elements of the authorities have some sympathy with the threats and intimidation. How do citizens of the republic governed by the constitution of knowledge deal with this problem? Rauch: I'm tempted to ask if that's a trick question because the answer is those that shouldn't happen, right? Biggest example of that I can think of is, what, 1,500 people or so were convicted for attempting to overthrow the U.S. government. Many of them committed violence; many committed violence against policemen. The first thing Donald Trump did was pardon them all and say, That's okay. And, and this is a shocking corruption of the social contract that we make with each other to protect a free society where disputes can be settled and we can be anchored to reality. It just shouldn't happen. Now, of course, you know, it's going to, but you don't want to institutionalize it, and that's what I'm afraid is happening right now in the U.S., maybe elsewhere. Frum: One of the most misunderstood essays of all time is Francis Fukuyama's 1989 essay The End of History?, where he is remembered as having said, Once you get to a liberal capitalist society, that's it. History stops. That's not what he said. What he said was, Once you get to liberal capitalist society, ideological development stops. You can go backwards to barbarism and cruelty and savagery and oppression, but you can't go forwards to a new dispensation. So my question to you as a believer in this constitution of knowledge: Was that right? We hear a lot today about post liberalism, about the desire to move to something beyond these rules that you described. This is offered not as a regression toward a barbarous past, but as an advance toward an even more promising future. Can the constitution of knowledge be time limited? And is there something on the other side of it? Rauch: I think Frank was right, actually, in the point that he was actually making, which you correctly summarize. He wasn't saying conflict will never occur or recur, but he was saying that there's no remaining alternative to liberalism—you know, small L liberalists and free markets and liberal democratic government and science broadly defined—and that the alternatives are not as good. And they've all been tried and they've all failed. And I think since he wrote that article, what, 36 years ago, a lot of alternatives have been tried. Really, they're old alternatives. Putin's trying one, and Xi is trying one, and Iran's trying one, and they're all going to fail. I'm not so sure about China yet. We'll see. But I'm pretty confident that that's not a system that will endure in the long term. So I think the same is true of the constitution of knowledge. There is—so what's unique about the reality based community, the rules of the constitution of knowledge, is that they're open ended and impersonal in the same way that markets are and in the same way that elections are. So everyone has to follow the same rules no matter who they are, which means that in principle, you can perform an experiment in Picton, Ontario, Canada, and someone speaking a different language in India can rerun the experiment and find out if you were right, or you can make an argument in a magazine and someone speaking Swahili in Africa can trace your logic and your cites and see if you're right. The only system that can set up a global network of hundreds of thousands of institutions and hundreds of millions of individuals trained to communicate with each other, to constantly exchange information in search of each other's errors, is the constitution of knowledge, because it's the only system that says what matters is your hypothesis, not who you are, and every hypothesis needs to be checked and rechecked before it's admitted as fact. No other system does that. No other system can turn all of humanity into a kind of global super brain that literally transforms the capacity of our species to know and literally creates more new knowledge every day before breakfast than was created by Homo sapiens in its first 200,000 years. No system that relies on priests or politbureaus or monarchs or sacred texts or oracles can ever come anywhere near that. Frum: What if we successfully break the global links, though? We are living now through a time where one of the big projects that the people in control of both the United States and China, two major powers, is to sever these kinds of connections: connections of information, sever connections of trade, sever connections of human contact. People who visit China tell me that it is striking when you go there how few Americans you now see. Whereas once you would've seen'20 years ago, you'd have seen many, many visitors and tourists and travelers and students, now it's a very rare thing to see an American there. Trade connections are being severed across the Atlantic and across the Pacific. Social media's creating these kinds of warring fiefdoms, with China locked, in its way, and tech oligarchs trying to control the American system, and the government of the United States looking for ways to commandeer those systems, to impose—they call them ombudsman—but really sort of truth commissars at major American media companies. Companies paying fines to the president if they say something he doesn't like, especially if it's true, in order to get permission for their corporate activities to continue. We've seen periods of global integration collapse. The Roman Empire collapsed and left behind lots of little principalities. The Victorian world system that came to its apogee in 1913 collapsed and left us with half a century of nationalism and violence. Could it happen again? On the intellectual domain, not just the trade and material domain? Rauch: So, it's harder to make that happen in the intellectual domain than in the domain of, say, trade, where you can impose a tariff and something comes off a ship and you slap it with what amounts to a tax. Or the realm of immigration, where you're dealing with physical bodies. Or for that matter, the realm of political nationalism, where you can bust up alliances, for example. It's harder to do that in the realm of knowledge, just because knowledge can be transmitted electronically over wires. So, one of the remarkable things that's happened over the last, well, century plus, but accelerating the last 20 years or so, has been international collaboration in science and journalism. Because what used to be quite difficult, which would be for, I don't know, David Frum to collaborate with a scientist or journalist in China, is now trivially easy. If you can surmount the language barrier, you're on Zoom, you're co authoring a paper, and so we've seen rapid rise, startling rise in international scientific collaboration, and that in turn has resulted in bringing on board lots of new minds, new thinking, new energy, new resources from places like India and Africa, which were kind of sidelined in the scientific community. So that process is hard to stop, right? Because it's going to be electronic and collaborational. Where you pay a cost—and I think are already paying a cost—is you do need some exchange of bodies. It is to the world's benefit, to the benefit of humanity and science, if students from around the world can study here. Learn how to do science from the best people here, take that back home with them, and teach it to the people at home and then bring them into this global system of knowledge seeking, or stay here and become leading scientists with the massive resources that are available. The Trump administration seems to be doing its best to cut those ties. It is cutting the funding for scientific research, including global. It is making it difficult for foreign students to come. A lot of people are not coming at this point because they're worried about getting nailed by immigration or losing a visa or losing funding. Francis Collins, former NIH [National Institutes of Health] director and others say we're experiencing, for the first time in memory, reverse brain drain, where most talented minds are leaving America, looking for work in Canada and places that are in Europe that are eager to recruit them. And that's going to hurt us as a nation, and it's also going to hurt the search for knowledge because you want the best minds put to work where they can work most efficiently and productively. And in many cases, that's still the United States. Frum: What if the human mind is constituted in a way that it chafes at the constitutional knowledge and actually doesn't want it? And we see lots of examples of how this could be so. People are drawn to conspiracy theories because conspiracy theories promise them that the universe is, even if malign, is organized by somebody. It's not just a blank and impersonal thing that is utterly indifferent to our fates. There's someone in charge, and that's a reassuring thing. One of the reasons that the anti vax deception finds winners is people want to believe that nature is benign, and that if we could just live more in harmony with it, we would be healthier and stronger. And, of course, we have seen that human beings—many of us, anyway—prefer to live in an orthodoxy enforced by some kind of supernatural guarantee than to live in all the uncertainties. That's what the crisis of modernity is all about, right? That you have to live with uncertainty and you have to accept your neighbor's certainty because you're uncertain about your uncertainty. What if we're not—what if it's just trying to make us live in ways that human beings don't want to live, and that rebellion against this, and maybe the system's overthrow, is in our genes? Rauch: Well, you can take off the what if part of that statement, because it's just unquestionably true. The constitution of knowledge, in particular, and all three of these liberal systems—free exchange and liberal democracy—are profoundly counterintuitive. Chapter 2 of my book The Constitution of Knowledge is about the massive numbers of cognitive and social distortions that make it difficult for us to challenge our own assumptions, to even know that our assumptions need challenging. As Madison says—I'll mangle the quote, but maybe you can get it—if all men were angels, we would not need a government. If people were naturally predisposed to question their mistakes, especially the things that they're most certain of, to put their ideas up for critical review, to change their mind, or at least put up with it when society changes its mind, we wouldn't need a constitution of knowledge, just as if we were all inclined to get along in a giant democracy without rules, we wouldn't need a U.S. Constitution. It is precisely because being based in reality as a society is so difficult and so counterintuitive that we need these rules. It's the reason it took 300 years to develop them to reach the point where they are today. I often say—you know, I've been a free speech nut since we were students together back in college. That's almost 50 years. And what I've learned in that period is that the single most crazy, counterintuitive social idea ever invented is the idea that the government should not only tolerate speech that is wrongheaded, bigoted, offensive, but actually protect the speech. That is the craziest, most counterintuitive idea ever—redeemed only by the fact that it is also the single most successful social idea ever. But the result of that is that you and I will have to get up every morning and defend these principles from scratch. And we just have to be cheerful about that. And there will be attack after attack on the constitution of knowledge. It started with Galileo, who was thrown into house arrest because he believed in the Copernican system. And if the people now who are trying to sic on to the government into wholesale distortion of reality are defeated, there will be something else coming along behind them. And that's just reality. Frum: And that leaves you thinking that the future looks like what? Rauch: Based on the past, the future looks good. It's not automatic. We have to understand that the people who are fighting the constitution of knowledge—especially Donald Trump, but also the cancel culture people, who have been very successful in the realm of academia, to some extent, journalism and corporate life—they're very sophisticated people and they're using very sophisticated, time honored propaganda and cognitive warfare tactics. But we have a couple things going for us. One is that people hate to live in an epistemically polluted system where they don't know what's true and they don't know what they can trust and they don't know whether they can take the vaccine and they don't know if anyone's ever telling them the truth. This is an experiment that was tried in the Soviet Union and many other places. It fails because people hate it. Over time, they will gravitate toward sources that prove reliable. It's not easy and it's not always obvious. There's this also second thing that the constitution of knowledge has going for it, which is reality. Here's the thing. If you stop vaccinating people for measles, guess what happens? You get measles. Then kids start to die. Then people look around and say, WTF? You can only suspend reality for so long before it hits you in the face. And that's been the undoing of all the regimes throughout history, which have tried to manipulate reality: They get high on their own supply, they believe their own propaganda, they lose track of truth, they become arrogant about their manipulations, and they succumb to reality. The best thing that we have going for us, for the constitution of knowledge, is there is no other system that can come close in terms of finding and discovering truth and keeping society moored to reality. That doesn't mean we win automatically. And it sure doesn't mean we win in the short run. [Hungarian Prime Minister] Viktor Orbn and Vladimir Putin and, for that matter, Donald Trump can do what they're doing for a significant amount of time and get away with a lot. But we are not where we are just because of hard work. Frum: Do you think the loss of print as the preferred medium of communication compromises or even dooms your project? Rauch: Well, as a longtime print journalist, I'm inclined to say, Duh. But I guess that would be self serving. It doesn't doom it; nothing dooms it. But it's a problem. And that's because print journalism has historically been the best at focusing resources to perform investigations, organizing editorial hierarchies that are careful about checking, creating newsrooms that are good at training the next generation in these methods, and having a business model that sustains that. The business model is now dead or dying. It's getting very hard to support those enterprises. Television has historically done good work, but it's been less good at it. Social media is much less good at it still because the incentives are wrong, and don't get me started on TikTok. And so it's a challenging environment. Frum: Jonathan, thank you. It's always a pleasure. I always learn from you. I've been learning from you for a long time. And as you have said, so I feel that our relationship has been one of the primordial bonds of my life. And I'm grateful that we can, thanks to the miracle of modern medicine and your constitution of knowledge, that we can hope to limp along a little longer. Rauch: It's an honor to be with you and a special privilege to be joined with you in what is a long term project to promote and protect the liberal principles that I learned so much about from you. Frum: Thank you. Bye bye. [Music] Frum: Thanks so much to Jonathan Rauch for joining me today on The David Frum Show. I hope that if you liked this dialogue, if you benefited from it, you will consider sharing it with others who might also enjoy it. And I hope you will consider subscribing to The Atlantic, which is the best way to support our work. And subscribe, of course, to this podcast, on any platform you use, video or audio. I also want to take a moment for a correction for a mistake I made in last week's monologue. I made a citation mistake last week. I quoted the journalist and author Walter Lippmann. The quote was accurate, but I sourced it to Lippmann's 1922 book Public Opinion. In fact, the book came from another book, first published in 1920: Liberty and the News. I apologize for my error; it has been noted in the transcript of the monologue on the Atlantic website. Thank you so much for joining us on The David Frum Show. Again, please like and subscribe and share. I'll look forward to seeing you next week back here on The David Frum Show. [Music] This episode of The David Frum Show was produced by Nathaniel Frum and edited by Andrea Valdez. It was engineered by Dave Grein. Our theme is by Andrew M. Edwards. Claudine Ebeid is the executive producer of Atlantic audio, and Andrea Valdez is our managing editor. I'm David Frum. Thank you for listening."

    "content":"AI has transformed my experience of education. I am a senior at a public high school in New York, and these tools are everywhere. I do not want to use them in the way I see other kids my age using them—I generally choose not to—but they are inescapable. During a lesson on the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, I watched a classmate discreetly shift in their seat, prop their laptop up on a crossed leg, and highlight the entirety of the chapter under discussion. In seconds, they had pulled up ChatGPT and dropped the text into the prompt box, which spat out an AI generated annotation of the chapter. These annotations are used for discussions; we turn them in to our teacher at the end of class, and many of them are graded as part of our class participation. What was meant to be a reflective, thought provoking discussion on slavery and human resilience was flattened into copy paste commentary. In Algebra II, after homework worksheets were passed around, I witnessed a peer use their phone to take a quick snapshot, which they then uploaded to ChatGPT. The AI quickly painted my classmate's screen with what it asserted to be a step by step solution and relevant graphs. These incidents were jarring—not just because of the cheating, but because they made me realize how normalized these shortcuts have become. Many homework assignments are due by 11:59 p.m., to be submitted online via Google Classroom. We used to share memes about pounding away at the keyboard at 11:57, anxiously rushing to complete our work on time. These moments were not fun, exactly, but they did draw students together in a shared academic experience. Many of us were propelled by a kind of frantic productivity as we approached midnight, putting the finishing touches on our ideas and work. Now the deadline has been sapped of all meaning. AI has softened the consequences of procrastination and led many students to avoid doing any work at all. As a consequence, these programs have destroyed much of what tied us together as students. There is little intensity anymore. Relatively few students seem to feel that the work is urgent or that they need to sharpen their own mind. We are struggling to receive the lessons of discipline that used to come from having to complete complicated work on a tight deadline, because chatbots promise to complete our tasks in seconds. Read: The AI takeover of education is just getting started Desperate to address AI, schools across the U.S. are investing in detection tools and screen monitoring software to curb cheating. Some of these tools have been used in my school: Teachers rely on plagiarism checkers and exam proctoring software. Still, these systems aren't foolproof, and many students have begun to bypass these measures. Students use AI humanizer tools, which rephrase text to remove robotic undertones, as one such program puts it, or they manually edit the AI's output themselves to simplify language or adjust the chatbot's sentence structure. During in class exams, screens may be locked or recording technology may be employed, but students have ways around these, too—sneaking phones in, for example. Based on what I've observed, preventative measures can only go so far. The trouble with chatbots is not just that they allow students to get away with cheating or that they remove a sense of urgency from academics. The technology has also led students to focus on external results at the expense of internal growth. The dominant worldview seems to be: Why worry about actually learning anything when you can get an A for outsourcing your thinking to a machine? During my sophomore year, I participated in my school's debate team. I was excited to have a space outside the classroom where creativity, critical thinking, and intellectual rigor were valued and sharpened. I love the rush of building arguments from scratch. ChatGPT was released back in 2022, when I was a freshman, but the debate team weathered that first year without being overly influenced by the technology—at least as far as I could tell. But soon, AI took hold there as well. Many students avoided the technology and still stand against it, but it was impossible to ignore what we saw at competitions: chatbots being used for research and to construct arguments between rounds. To me, debate is about forming your own arguments and pushing yourself to refute curveball counters. It's about developing the skills to outthink and out argue your opponent. It isn't about who can present the best cookie cutter AI arguments with polished and possibly invented data. Something I once loved now feels empty. Read: College students have already changed forever AI is not all bad. Some students may use these tools to develop their understanding or explore topics more deeply, serving their intellectual curiosity without actually cheating. AI can also be used as a study aid—say, quizzing you on vocabulary ahead of a Spanish test. But the temptation to abuse these tools is always there. I am concerned about what will happen as the short term solutions presented by chatbots become the only ones that people know how to pursue—especially beyond the classroom. If we keep leaning on AI to sidestep pressure or deadlines, what happens when the tools aren't there? In the real world, chatbots cannot hold the powerful to account in the way an investigative reporter does, through relentless interviews and vetting hard t0 find information. They cannot perform open heart surgery or ballet. Many of us are so accustomed to outsourcing that we're dulling the very instincts that we need to prevail in life: grit, critical thinking, and the ability to function smoothly under stress. It will take more than AI detectors and screen monitoring to address this disconnect. Student assessments should be focused on tasks that are not easily delegated to technology: oral exams, for instance, in which students walk educators through their thinking process, or personalized writing assignments that are unique to the student or current events. Portfolio based or presentational grading could be emphasized over traditional exams or pop quizzes, giving students ample time to earn their grades. Students can also be encouraged to reflect on their own work—using learning journals or discussion to express their struggles, approaches, and lessons learned after each assignment. These strategies could create an academic environment where integrity, creativity, and original thought thrive. Whatever the path forward, it must be forged soon. If chatbots have made school easier to get through, they are also making school equally as hard to grow out of. The technology is producing a generation of eternal novices, unable to think or perform for themselves."

Messengers, all of us, speaking the word God left us in this weary land. Messengers with the word as their spear, messengers speaking life into each brick, each crop, each stitch, each book we made.

    "content":"Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts This fall, when vaccine season comes around, everything might seem like business as usual. Vaccine schedules for kids are more or less intact, and the new flu and COVID vaccines are both scheduled to be released in time for the expected winter surge. The Trump administration hasn't had much of a visible effect on vaccines as the shots currently exist. What's being systematically dismantled is the infrastructure that creates, tracks, and facilitates the distribution of vaccines as we've come to know and rely on them. One clue about what's really happening: Late last month, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. laid out new restrictions for COVID vaccines, announcing that they would only be recommended for people ages 65 and older or those at risk of suffering serious health consequences from the disease. This isn't an entirely surprising development; many people feel ambivalent about the COVID vaccines, which makes them an easy target for disruption. But this move does set a dangerous precedent, according to the Atlantic science writer Katie Wu. She argues that what Kennedy is really doing is establishing the narrative that there was something wrong with the vaccine system. Once that distrust is normalized, he could use it to discredit any vaccine—past or future. Without clear federal directions for issuing guidelines, states are already starting to chart different paths on vaccines. Governors in California, Washington State, and Oregon said they intend to coordinate on vaccine recommendations. Florida's surgeon general went in the opposite direction, announcing a plan to end all state vaccine mandates, which he compared to slavery. We talk to Wu about how Kennedy's decisions are affecting the vaccine pipeline and how difficult it will be to rebuild. We also talk about what you, the patient, should do in an atmosphere where the federal government, long the authority on vaccines, is no longer reliable. The following is a transcript of the episode: [Music] Hanna Rosin: In the final days before the election last fall, presidential candidate Donald Trump told a crowd in New York City about his goals for bringing Robert F. Kennedy Jr. into the MAGA verse. President Donald Trump: I'm gonna let him go wild on health. I'm gonna let him go wild on the food. (Crowd cheers.) I'm gonna let him go wild on medicines. Rosin: Wild on medicines—or more accurately, vaccines. That has been apparent over the past couple of months. Jake Tapper (from CNN): There is unease, if not panic, in the medical community after HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ousted the entire CDC vaccine advisory committee. Lester Holt (from NBC News): In Texas, an unvaccinated child has died from measles. The first death from the disease in a decade comes amid a growing outbreak in Texas. Shanelle Kaul (from CBS News): Confusion about who can access vaccines mirrors chaos at the CDC. The White House named a new interim head of the agency with no medical background, prompting the resignation of four senior officials at the CDC. Rosin: I'm Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic. Recently, the FDA limited the next round of COVID vaccines to people 65 plus or at risk of serious health complications. And then last week, the administration fired the director of the Centers for Disease Control, and then several key officials resigned in protest. Now, if you're visiting the doctor this month, you're not likely to immediately notice these changes. But behind the scenes, the American vaccine infrastructure that has been in place for decades is coming apart—and that could have massive consequences. To explain exactly how, we have science writer Katie Wu. Katie, welcome back to Radio Atlantic. Katie Wu: Always good to be here. Rosin: So last time I talked about vaccines on this show, which was in December, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was just nominated as secretary of HHS, and we talked a lot about vaccine infrastructure and how it was more fragile than people realized and could easily come apart. But then, it was totally theoretical; we had no idea what would actually happen. So when you look back at his tenure, which is seven months or so, what are, say, three important vaccine moments that stand out to you? Wu: I'd say he really started setting the tune for his tenure when he began responding to the measles outbreak—a response that was delayed and then a response that was heavily focused on vitamin A rather than vaccination, which is far and away the best way to prevent and help contain measles outbreaks, which basically only happen in this country when vaccination rates drop. At the FDA, he has pressured his appointees to restrict COVID vaccine approval so that it will be much, much, much harder for the public to access COVID vaccines in the future. And he's done a kind of mirror image move at CDC, where he has limited the recommendations for COVID vaccines and also, very recently, ousted officials that he thinks would have stood in his way if he were to enact further changes in that respect. And also, adjacent to CDC, he has totally dismissed the expert panel that advises the CDC on vaccines and replaced them with handpicked appointees, many of whom totally lack expertise in vaccines and are openly anti COVID vaccine or anti all vaccine. Rosin: Right, and those are very important data points. Would you say definitively—I'm trying to take a temperature check since, back then, we were a maybe that RFK Jr. and the Trump administration are trying to disrupt the vaccination program, upend the vaccination program? Is there a verb that you feel good definitively getting behind? Wu: I think there's a lot of verbs I could get behind, but probably the one that is particularly apt for this moment is, I would say, he's dismantling vaccine infrastructure. If you look at the immunization schedule right now, it doesn't necessarily look so different than it did last year. The most notable difference right now is changes in recommendations for COVID vaccines, and I do expect further change to occur, but right now, if that's your metric, it might not look so bad. But I think that's a very particular way to look at the vaccine situation. If you look, instead, at the way vaccine policy is shaped at the pipeline that vaccines travel through to get from invention to approval to recommended to actually being accessible by the public, that is where everything is a mess. And so even though, it's not like, Oh, we have taken away MMR and the hep B vaccine, and you can no longer get the HPV vaccine—it's not like it's that. It's more that they have just fractured this entire pipeline so that vaccines that have any hope of reaching the public, I think it's teeing us up for disaster. Rosin: I understand. So right now, as a parent—I am a parent; I'm not saying, Theoretically, as a parent—if I look at the vaccine schedule for kids, it will look the same. Like, my daily life going to the doctor, it will be basically the same as it was before RFK Jr. took office. But somewhere down the road, the whole idea of vaccines—how they get created, how they get approved, how we build trust in them—that's what's collapsing? Wu: Yeah, I think that's right. I think if you go to the pediatrician now, things will feel mostly the same. But I think what RFK has done in these past few months is he has basically, (Laughs.) I guess I can say, greased the axles on his anti vaccine machine. Basically, if he wants to make further changes to the schedule, they will come easier now that he has basically staffed all the personnel at HHS with like minded people. He has sort of set precedent in terms of changing policies at FDA and CDC that will make it easier to rip vaccines away from Americans. Rosin: Right. I mean, what I'm taking from this is that we started his tenure alerting people that the vaccine infrastructure was indeed more fragile than it seemed, and now we're actually seeing that play out. This week, RFK Jr. wrote in The Wall Street Journal about trust. He wrote that trust has collapsed, that the American people no longer believe the CDC has their best interests at heart, and he is here to restore that trust and return the CDC to its core mission. How do you understand this op ed that he wrote? 'Cause trust is an important word, and that is true—trust has collapsed in the system—so that sentence is correct. Wu: Right. And I think that's exactly it, right? That's what makes this op ed a potentially powerful politician's tool. I think RFK is very good at saying things that feel incontrovertible or unimpeachable in some way, like: We need more trust. We need healthier children. We love safe vaccines. Great, me too! But I think this is the thing: The sort of evidence that he uses to support this case, that trust has collapsed and the American people have been failed by this corrupt CDC, I don't see that. And certainly, the folks who have run the CDC and worked at CDC and benefited from CDC—which, let's be clear, is all of us—I don't think people generally see it that way. Sure, there have been public health missteps, including, very recently, during the pandemic. The CDC is not perfect. The government is not perfect. Public health officials are not perfect. There have been errors that should be faced full on and addressed in the future. But he's painting this as an agency that has just been corrupted by pharmaceutical influence and overridden by ideology, and vaccines are not a proud hallmark feature of their work. And I just—I have never seen it that way. I think you would be hard pressed to find someone who has followed the evidence, followed the facts in this country, and actually does see it that way. It is true that the data, the polling has shown that trust in public health officials, in scientists, even in primary care physicians has dipped somewhat in recent years, and I do think some of that is attributable to the pandemic and also the increasing politicization of science. But a lot of people still do generally trust in science and medicine and public health. That is why people who have primary care physicians go to their doctors and ask, Hey, what should I do? It's why most people in this country still say they get their children vaccinated—and not just because their schools require it. They support this kind of general infrastructure, and they support funding of public health initiatives, research into science and medicine. People want cancer cures, and they trust that there are experts in this country that are being funded to do that work. I think Kennedy is spinning this narrative to support his own political agenda—which, sure, that is what politicians do, but I think he's weaponizing this skewed portrait of science to do so. Rosin: I wanna talk about this at the point that it interfaces with people. Let's start with the COVID vaccine. So recently, RFK Jr. limited the availability of the COVID vaccine, saying that people without underlying health conditions and people under the age of 65 had to consult with their doctor. What difference does something like that make? Wu: I think it makes a difference on multiple fronts. I mean, first and foremost, this is a restriction, right? There are people under the age of 65 who want that vaccine. I'm happy to say I was planning to get a COVID vaccine this fall, and I am still going to try to get one, but frankly, I have very little sense right now of how available that vaccine will be to me, if it'll even be on the market in the same way it is now, whether my pharmacy will be willing to give it to me, if my insurer will cover it. It feels like a mess, and having that option taken away from me when the evidence itself hasn't changed makes me feel vulnerable. More people will get sick if they cannot get a vaccine that has the potential to protect them. That is just how the vaccine math works. I think the other aspect of this is it's philosophical. It's precedent setting, right? This was maybe an easy domino to tip over initially because there has been more ambivalence about the COVID vaccine. This is a newer vaccine. This is an especially politicized vaccine. It's a little bit of pandering to Trump's base. I mean, I think a lot of people in that group still have some lingering bitterness over the pandemic—understandably. That was a really difficult time. As we mentioned before, public health messaging was not perfect during that time. This is kind of an easy vaccine to push around. But once you start that, it makes it a lot easier to say, We showed you. (Sighs.) This vaccine, it's got some issues. We restricted it. It sort of feeds into this narrative that there was something wrong with the vaccine system. They're pulling back on recommendations that were already issued; why not do the same for other vaccines? Rosin: Right, so it's, like, a gateway move. You take the weakest link, you establish what the narrative is, and then you apply that narrative to other vaccines. Wu: Exactly. And I mean, it's also an interesting way for them to sort of do their own little beta tests—like, Can we do this? Did we pull on the correct threads at FDA and CDC? And it seems like they certainly did. Now they have a playbook for the next one, and the next one, and the next one. Rosin: After the break, what different states around the country are doing as the federal government makes its anti vax turn. That's in a moment. [Music] [Break] Rosin: This week has been short but filled with vaccine news. California, Oregon, and Washington State announced they're joining together to coordinate vaccine recommendations in a thing they're calling the West Coast Health Alliance. On the other side of the political spectrum, you have Florida. The state's surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo, made this announcement on Wednesday. Joseph Ladapo: 'an announcement that we're going to make, that we're making now, which is that the Florida Department of Health, in partnership with the governor, is going to be working to end all vaccine mandates in Florida law. (Crowd applauds.) All of them. All of them. Rosin: This news would make Florida the first state to end vaccine requirements, including for schoolchildren. Ladapo: Every last one of them is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery. Who am I, as a government or anyone else—or who am I as a man standing here now—to tell you what you should put in your body? Rosin: So, Katie, we have more liberal states organizing to develop recommendations outside the federal government and then the most loudly anti vax state ending vaccine mandates. How do you make sense of this news? Wu: I think this is more of the same of what we've already been seeing for a few weeks or months now: this fracturing of the American landscape on vaccines. Increasingly, scientists and public health experts across the country are feeling that the federal government is no longer an ally in keeping Americans safe from infectious disease, and so different parties are striking off on their own. We've seen professional medical societies doing this, developing their own sets of recommendations. States are now doing the same. And a lot of them, I think, are trying to be in line with those professional medical societies so that there will be some sort of consistency. But because not every state is doing this—and some states are going in what is, essentially, the opposite direction—this really will lead to a kind of patchwork across the country, which is gonna make it extremely confusing to live here or, God forbid, move between states. Rosin: So you've described it as a continuation of what we'd been seeing, but Florida sounds like it's crossing a line—I mean, both in the tone and the totality of that mandate. Is that true, or have you seen that before? Wu: I do think Florida is crossing a line here, and this is pretty unprecedented in one respect—though, I will say, we did have some precedent for states striking off in different directions and lifting mandates or regulations or recommendations at different times, during COVID, for instance. So this isn't shocking in one respect, but for Florida to do this, in particular with school mandates, it's especially dangerous and it's especially bold because what happens to kids in Florida does not just affect kids in Florida. People travel between states in this country. People travel in and out of this country constantly. This is risking Florida becoming a reservoir for all sorts of diseases that will spill over into the rest of the country and endanger us all. Rosin: I wanna talk about the Centers for Disease Control. At Kennedy's behest, Trump removed CDC Director Susan Monarez, who'd only been on the job a few weeks, and then several key CDC officials resigned. What is the CDC's role in the vaccine infrastructure? Why does it matter to the average American who's in charge there? Wu: Yeah, CDC is a huge deal, and I think a good way to frame this is: The FDA approves vaccines, so they basically say, Here are the vaccines that you can get. And then CDC takes those available tools and recommends how people should get them. And so CDC recommendations are incredibly powerful. They publish the national immunization schedule, and these are not mandates, but they are national recommendations that guide how states require vaccines in schools, how pediatricians recommend vaccines in their offices. It's this unified grand theory of how we do immunization in this country. Without the national immunization schedule, there may not be a super clear universal resource for doctors to turn to. For example, pediatricians do have the American Academy of Pediatrics—that's their professional society—and they also publish vaccine recommendations. Other groups like family medicine physicians or obstetrics and gynecology [physicians] may do something similar, but it's not the same unified across all of health and medicine, across the entire nation, kind of sweeping Here is the national recommendation for all of you to follow so that things will mostly look the same in Kentucky as they do in Florida, as they do in Massachusetts, as they do in New York. It's just gonna be a little bit of a mess everywhere. Rosin: Right, which is like so much else. I guess what I'm taking from what you're saying is how deeply, deeply politicized vaccines have become. So the COVID vaccine we all know was politicized, and all of COVID, but now the entire vaccine infrastructure is politicized. It's, like, red stateblue state vaccines. Wu: Yeah, I mean, it may start to look that way, right? I don't think it will fall perfectly along political lines; I think it's worth mentioning that some red states have historically been some of the ones with the highest childhood vaccination rates, in part because of how they do school entry mandates, and that's really notable. But, I mean, it's hard to predict exactly where things will go, just that things are likely to look different in a lot of places. And I think access is also gonna be a big issue, right, I mean, depending on how insurers decide to cover these vaccines. Insurers have typically looked to CDC recommendations to decide what vaccines they're going to cover. If CDC starts recommending fewer vaccines or if CDC is telling them one thing while the American Academy of Pediatrics is telling them another, who are they gonna follow? Is it gonna differ by state? We're already seeing a little bit of chaos with CVS and Walgreens deciding to do different things in different states when it comes to vaccines. Immunization and just being protected from infectious diseases generally works best when as many people as possible have a degree of immunity. Infectious diseases are everywhere all the time. The reason that we don't get more sick more often than we do is because we have immunity, and when we start to take those barriers down, those pathogens, those viruses, those bacteria, they're not going to pull back on their offense. They're still gonna be there, and we'll just be more vulnerable. Rosin: We actually have seen a measles outbreak, and there was interesting reporting in KFF Health News that showed confusion at the CDC did actually prevent the agency from correctly responding in Texas. What did you see playing out in the measles outbreak that already happened? Wu: Right, and I think this is a really good example to look at because those children were already unvaccinated before RFK took over. But I think what's key to focus on is the response, or lack thereof, from HHS. I think under a different administration—and we have had other measles outbreaks in recent decades under different administrations. There should have been a really strong, concerted response led by CDC, led by the secretary of HHS, championing vaccination, sending resources, ensuring that people were well informed about what causes these sorts of outbreaks—again, lower vaccination rates—and having clear corrective action. The response this time around was muted. It was not terribly focused on vaccines. It pushed unproven treatments that may have endangered some people's lives. And in Kennedy's recent op ed that we were talking about, he honestly had the most bizarre description of the response to this outbreak. He praised it and said things that I fundamentally disagree with, like the outbreak ended quickly. Did it? It was the largest measles outbreak we've had in this country in decades. Measles was declared eliminated in this country about 25 years ago, and suddenly, we have this massive outbreak in which multiple people have died, and you call that an outbreak that ended quickly? He also proudly described the outbreak [response] as neither pro vax' nor antivax.' A reasonable and science based response from HHS to a measles outbreak should fundamentally be pro vaccine. Rosin: I have to say, I was surprised by how that played out, because I think, when he first took office, I had in my head, Okay, one child will die, or two children will die, and then it will end all this anti vaccine sentiment. Like, people will just kind of wake up from this and realize, Oh no, vaccines keep children from dying, and that is not what happened. Wu: I think, immediately, when you saw those children die, you saw people pointing to, Oh, they must have had underlying conditions. They must have been malnourished. Look, that's support for this broader narrative about chronic diseases being the primary issue, nutrition being the primary issue. People see what they want to see, and I think that is a really powerful way for politicians to push their particular narrative. I do think it was encouraging that a lot of people's response to this outbreak was to ensure that their kids were vaccinated or even get their kids early vaccines if they were close to the outbreak region. That was a very smart move if that's what they did. But that definitely was not universal, and measles outbreaks are a kind of a canary in the coal mine. We start here, but it is just a prelude for many, many more similar outbreaks to come. Rosin: Right. Okay, so we've described a situation where the infrastructure is falling apart. It's a little bit of a free fall. There are not people at the CDC who can stop it. In other actions that Trump and his administration have taken, we generally have relied on the courts, say, as a backstop against some of the more extreme policies. Is there a backstop when it comes to public health? Is there someone who can say no to the secretary of HHS or the CDC? Wu: So there certainly have been legal challenges to some of what Kennedy has done at HHS. For example, the American Academy of Pediatrics and some other professional societies sued HHS. Individual researchers have sued HHS and Kennedy. It definitely has happened. But for the most part, I have actually not really seen as many successful legal challenges as I might have hoped to see, which, to me, tells me that the system of checks and balances is not really holding Kennedy to account. And in particular, in the realm of public health, the secretary is extremely powerful. We have seen some moves at HHS overridden by the White House but not very many. It seems, for the most part, Trump has been pretty happy to let Kennedy do what he wants. He does not seem to be standing in the way of his anti vaccine moves—including moves that have fundamentally undermined Operation Warp Speed, which was, if you remember, the Trump initiative in 2020 that got us COVID vaccines so quickly. Rosin: Okay, so (Laughs.) that's a no for the short term. Maybe my last question, then, is about the long term: Can you build back up a vaccine infrastructure? What does that
