    title: "Our AI Fears Run Long and Deep",
    published_at: "2025-09-01",
    author: "Tom Nichols",
    section: "ideas",
    topic: "Computers, Software, & Technology",
    excerpt: "This is the voice of World Control, a metallic, nonhuman baritone blared from a spherical speaker atop a bank of computers. I bring you peace. It may be the peace of plenty and content, or the peace of unburied death. AI is one of the great hopes, and great fears, of the 21st century, but for more than 50 years, popular culture has been wrestling with the idea of computer sentience as both savior and nemesis. In movies, television shows, and literature, how AI has been portrayed reveals not only what we want from this technology, but also what we fear in ourselves."

    title: "What Is AI Watchdog?",
    published_at: "2025-09-10",
    author: "Alex Reisner",
    section: "technology",
    topic: "Computers, Software, & Technology",
    excerpt: "Generative AI companies have established extraordinary influence over how people seek and access information. Chatbots, which confidently promise to answer any question and can generate images and videos remarkably quickly, are replacing traditional search engines and human experts as go to sources of knowledge. Yet their inputs—the data that determine how chatbots respond to their users—are secrets closely guarded by powerful companies that are fighting intensely with one another for AI dominance."

    title: "I'm a High Schooler. AI Is Demolishing My Education.",
    published_at: "2025-09-03",
    author: "Ashanty Rosario",
    section: "technology",
    topic: "Schools & Education",
    excerpt: "AI has transformed my experience of education. I am a senior at a public high school in New York, and these tools are everywhere. I do not want to use them in the way I see other kids my age using them—I generally choose not to—but they are inescapable. During a lesson on the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, I watched a classmate discreetly shift in their seat, prop their laptop up on a crossed leg, and highlight the entirety of the chapter under discussion. In seconds, they had pulled up ChatGPT."

    title: "When AI Becomes a Ouija Board",
    published_at: "2025-09-15",
    author: "Webb Wright",
    section: "technology",
    topic: "Computers, Software, & Technology",
    excerpt: "One of the persistent questions in our brave new world of generative AI: If a chatbot is conversant like a person, if it reasons and behaves like one, then is it possibly conscious like a person? Geoffrey Hinton, a recent Nobel Prize winner and one of the so called godfathers of AI, told the journalist Andrew Marr earlier this year that AI has become so advanced and adept at reasoning that we're now creating beings. The more effective AI becomes in its use of natural language, the more seductive the pull will be to believe that it's living and feeling, just like us."

    title: "The Marriage Effect",
    published_at: "2025-09-03",
    author: "Jean M. Twenge",
    section: "ideas",
    topic: "Life, Sex, & Relationships",
    excerpt: "Recent trends are even more concerning: AI girlfriends and boyfriends now offer the prospect of relationships with an always available entity that has no needs of its own. Meanwhile, the fertility rate in the U.S. is at an all time low. There are many reasons people choose not to have children or not to get married, but false messages about happiness should not be one of them. After all, an AI boyfriend can't hug you back—to say nothing of an AI child."

    title: "Welcome to the Vaccine Free for All",
    published_at: "2025-09-04",
    author: "Hanna Rosin",
    section: "podcasts",
    topic: "Health, Healthcare, & Disease",
    excerpt: "The trouble with chatbots is not just that they allow students to get away with cheating or that they remove a sense of urgency from academics. The technology has also led students to focus on external results at the expense of internal growth. The dominant worldview seems to be: Why worry about actually learning anything when you can get an A for outsourcing your thinking to a machine?"

    title: "Why Theme Parks Keep Getting More Extreme",
    published_at: "2025-09-14",
    author: "Bianca Bosker",
    section: "culture",
    topic: "Movies & Hollywood",
    excerpt: "When Disneyland opened, it was the most exciting technological thing you could see, Phil Hettema, who spent more than a decade working on Universal's parks, told me. Now there's nothing I can see anywhere in the world that I can't see on my iPhone. To meet this challenge, rides are bumping against the limits of physics and the human body to deliver experiences that are more death defying than ever before."

    published_at: "2025-09-04",
    author: "Charlie Warzel",
    section: "technology",
    topic: "Violence, Guns, & Shootings",
    excerpt: "These disaffected communities live on social networks, message boards, and private Discords. They are populated by trolls, gore addicts, and, of course, aspiring shooters, who study, debate, and praise mass shooting tactics and manifestos. The dynamics at play reveal not just ideological elements, but the self-reinforcing legacy of these shooters in online spaces."

    published_at: "2025-09-01",
    author: "Lauren Grodstein",
    section: "books",
    topic: "Russia & Eastern Europe",
    excerpt: "In my work as a writer, I now find myself actively accommodating the priorities of the government. On a federal grant application, I revamped a project to seem unimpeachably patriotic. On another, I wiped out words including diversity and Nigerian American. The Georgians I met have chosen protest as a way of life because they have never lived with the illusion that rights, once granted, are permanent."
