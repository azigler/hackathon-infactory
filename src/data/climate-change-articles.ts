    excerpt: "The breaches on Friday and Saturday were to be expected, but they are still shockingly impactful.",
    fullContent: `The breaches on Friday and Saturday were to be expected, but, he says, they are still shockingly impactful. As nations gather in Dubai later this month for COP28, the United Nations climate negotiations, it's crucial to understand what these figures signify for our collective future. They're a signal of a new baseline era—one in which normalization is less and less tolerable, and irregularities are less possible to wave off.

Right now, emissions are still rising nearly every year; according to a new UN report on the global emissions gap, even if every nation managed to follow through on its stated emission reduction plans, the world would still be on track for nearly 3 degrees Celsius of global warming by 2100.

The implications of this trajectory are profound. We are no longer discussing a future scenario—we are living in the early stages of climate transformation. The ecosystems that have supported human civilization for millennia are being fundamentally altered.

Scientists have been warning about these thresholds for decades. The 1.5 degrees Celsius target, established in the Paris Agreement, was meant to serve as a guardrail against the most catastrophic outcomes. Crossing it, even temporarily, signals that our window for prevention has largely closed.

What remains now is adaptation. Communities around the world must prepare for conditions that no human society has ever experienced. Coastal cities face rising seas. Agricultural regions confront shifting growing seasons. And extreme weather events—once considered rare—are becoming routine.

The economic costs are staggering. Insurance companies are retreating from climate-vulnerable markets. Governments are spending billions on disaster recovery instead of prevention. And the burden falls disproportionately on those who contributed least to the problem.

Yet there are reasons for measured optimism. Renewable energy costs have plummeted faster than anyone predicted. Electric vehicles are reaching cost parity with internal combustion engines. And a new generation of climate activists is pushing for more ambitious action.

The question is no longer whether the climate is changing—that debate ended long ago. The question is whether we can adapt quickly enough to preserve what matters most: stable societies, functioning ecosystems, and a livable planet for future generations.

This moment demands both urgency and resolve. The new baseline Earth requires a new baseline for human response.`

    title: "The Electricity Industry Quietly Spread Climate Denial for Years",
    published_at: "2022-09-07",
    author: "Robinson Meyer",
    section: "science",
    topic: "Climate & the Environment",
    excerpt: "By the late '80s, the industry had started to channel a certain learned helplessness.",
    fullContent: `By the late '80s, the industry had started to channel a certain learned helplessness: Even if the greenhouse effect was real, executives argued, neither the power sector nor the United States could solve it alone. Then the science became unmistakable. In 1988, one of NASA's top climate scientists told a Senate panel that global warming had already begun.

The industry's leaders made a fateful decision: They began denying that climate change existed altogether. The Edison Electric Institute and three utilities helped establish the Global Climate Coalition, one of the most notorious advocates of climate denial and doubt.

This history matters because it reveals a pattern that continues today. Industries facing existential threats from climate policy have consistently chosen delay over adaptation. They fund think tanks that manufacture uncertainty. They lobby against regulations that would accelerate the clean energy transition. And they frame climate action as economically ruinous—even as renewable energy becomes increasingly cost-competitive.

The electricity industry's internal documents tell a damning story. As early as the 1960s, utility executives were briefed on the potential for carbon dioxide emissions to alter the global climate. They understood the science. They chose to suppress it.

The parallels to the tobacco industry's campaign against cancer science are striking. In both cases, corporations possessed knowledge that their products posed serious risks to public health. In both cases, they launched sophisticated disinformation campaigns to protect their bottom line.

But there's a crucial difference. Tobacco primarily harms those who choose to use it. Carbon emissions affect everyone on Earth, including future generations who have no voice in today's decisions.

The legal implications are becoming clearer. Cities and states are filing lawsuits against fossil fuel companies, alleging that they knew about climate risks and deliberately misled the public. Some cases invoke consumer protection laws. Others draw on public nuisance doctrine.

What's the path forward? First, we must acknowledge this history. The climate crisis was not inevitable—it was manufactured by powerful interests that prioritized short-term profits over long-term survival.

Second, we must hold accountable those who continue to spread disinformation. Climate denial has evolved from outright rejection to more subtle forms of delay and deflection. "Natural gas as a bridge fuel" and "carbon capture will save us" are today's versions of yesterday's denial.

Third, we must accelerate the transition to clean energy. The good news is that this transition is already underway. The economics now favor renewables in most markets. What's needed is political will to overcome the remaining barriers.

The electricity industry's dark history should serve as a warning. When powerful interests choose denial over action, everyone pays the price. The question now is whether we've learned that lesson in time.`

    title: "The 1.5 Degree Goal Is All But Dead",
    published_at: "2022-04-06",
    author: "Robinson Meyer",
    section: "science",
    topic: "Climate & the Environment",
    excerpt: "It's still technically possible to meet the 1.5 degree limit, but the window for technical feasibility is rapidly shrinking.",
    fullContent: `It's still technically possible to meet the 1.5 degree limit, but the window even for technical feasibility is rapidly shrinking. Since the initial report was published in 2018, global emissions have continued to rise, so it will be harder to achieve 1.5 degrees now than it was even when that report was written.

Even of the scenarios they evaluate, only a third of them are able to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius with any confidence. Even though the goal remains possible, the report makes clear that enough fossil fuel infrastructure to blow past the goal has already been built.

This isn't alarmism—it's mathematics. The carbon budget for 1.5 degrees is finite. Every ton of CO2 we emit today is a ton we can't emit tomorrow. And we've already used most of our budget.

The implications extend beyond temperature. Each fraction of a degree brings additional consequences: more intense hurricanes, longer droughts, higher sea levels, greater species loss. The difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees isn't marginal—it represents millions of lives and trillions of dollars.

So what does this mean for climate policy? First, we must stop treating 1.5 degrees as a realistic target for emissions reductions alone. Meeting it would require not just eliminating emissions but actively removing carbon from the atmosphere at massive scale—technology that doesn't yet exist commercially.

Second, we need honest conversations about adaptation. If 2 degrees or more is likely, communities need to start planning now. This means harder conversations about managed retreat from coastlines, infrastructure investments for extreme heat, and agricultural transitions for changing growing conditions.

Third, we must reject the false choice between mitigation and adaptation. Both are necessary. Reducing emissions limits how bad things get. Adaptation helps us survive what's coming.

The psychological challenge is real. How do we motivate action when the most ambitious goal seems out of reach? The answer lies in reframing. Every tenth of a degree we prevent is a victory. Every community we help adapt is a life preserved. The work matters even if perfection is impossible.

Scientists have been remarkably accurate in their projections. The warming we're experiencing today was predicted decades ago. This should give us confidence in their warnings about what's coming—and urgency to act on their recommendations.

The 1.5 degree goal may be dying, but the fight for a livable planet continues. The question is no longer whether we can prevent all harm, but how much harm we're willing to accept—and how much we're willing to sacrifice to prevent more.`

    title: "A Cold Spot Near the Galápagos Is Fending Off Climate Change",
    published_at: "2022-11-19",
    author: "Richard Kemeny",
    section: "science",
    topic: "Climate & the Environment",
    excerpt: "As a result of climate change, almost every part of the ocean is heating up. But off the west coast of the Galápagos Islands is a patch of cold, nutrient rich water.",
    fullContent: `As a result of climate change, almost every part of the ocean is heating up. But off the west coast of the Galápagos Islands is a patch of cold, nutrient rich water. This prosperous patch feeds phytoplankton and breathes life into the archipelago.

The cool water sustains populations of penguins, marine iguanas, sea lions, fur seals, and cetaceans that would not be able to stay on the equator year round. Over the past four decades, this cold patch has cooled by roughly half a degree. Its persistence has scientists wondering how long that will hold.

The Galápagos represent one of nature's great experiments in isolation and adaptation. Darwin's observations here helped form the theory of evolution. Today, the islands serve as a natural laboratory for understanding how ecosystems respond to climate stress.

The cold spot's resilience offers hope—and important lessons. It demonstrates that natural systems can, under certain conditions, buffer against warming trends. But it also highlights how precarious such refugia can be.

Marine biologists have documented the mechanisms at work. Deep, cold water from the Cromwell Current wells up along the western islands, creating an oasis of productivity in otherwise warming seas. Phytoplankton bloom in the nutrient-rich upwelling, supporting a food web that extends to the charismatic megafauna tourists flock to see.

But this system is vulnerable. Changes in ocean circulation, driven by climate change, could weaken or redirect the upwelling. El Niño events, which suppress the cold water, are becoming more intense. The 1982-83 and 1997-98 El Niños devastated Galápagos marine life.

Conservation strategies must account for this uncertainty. Protecting the cold spot from local stressors—overfishing, pollution, invasive species—gives it the best chance of surviving global ones. It's a form of climate adaptation: reducing non-climate pressures so ecosystems can better cope with climate change.

The Galápagos also illustrate the interconnection of climate impacts. Warming waters affect not just marine species but the terrestrial ecosystems that depend on marine nutrients. Seabirds that feed on fish fertilize the islands with their guano. Disrupt the marine food web, and ripple effects spread across the entire archipelago.

Scientists continue to monitor the cold spot, hoping to understand its limits. How much warming can it withstand? How will it respond to more frequent El Niños? The answers matter not just for the Galápagos but for our understanding of climate refugia worldwide.

In an era of global change, local resilience becomes precious. The Galápagos cold spot reminds us that nature still holds surprises—and that protecting these anomalies may be crucial for preserving biodiversity in a warming world.`

    title: "The Banality of Bad Faith Science",
    published_at: "2023-09-27",
    author: "Benjamin Mazer",
    section: "science",
    topic: "Research & Studies",
    excerpt: "Do scientists lie? 'I left out the full truth to get my climate change paper published,' the climatologist Patrick Brown wrote.",
    fullContent: `Do scientists lie? "I left out the full truth to get my climate change paper published," the climatologist Patrick Brown wrote in an essay, just days after his research had appeared in the journal Nature. The paper's main finding, that global warming makes extreme wildfires more common, was based on a willful oversimplification of reality, he confessed—and it did not represent his private view that other factors are as or more important.

Brown's confession sparked immediate controversy. Climate scientists criticized him for undermining public trust in research. Skeptics seized on his admission as evidence that climate science is systematically biased. Both reactions missed the deeper issue.

The problem Brown identified is real, but it's not unique to climate science. Academic incentives reward novelty, clarity, and impact—not nuance, uncertainty, or complexity. Researchers across fields face pressure to craft narratives that journals will publish and media will cover.

This creates what Brown called "a systematic bias toward publishing papers with cleaner, more alarming findings." Studies that find dramatic effects get attention. Studies that find "it's complicated" get ignored. The result is a scientific literature that may systematically overstate certainty and understate complexity.

But Brown's proposed solution—acknowledging complexity that might muddy the climate message—carries its own risks. In a media environment where bad-faith actors exploit any uncertainty, nuance can become a weapon against action. "Scientists aren't sure" has been used for decades to delay climate policy.

The tension is genuine and difficult. How do scientists communicate uncertainty honestly without enabling denial? How do they simplify complex findings for public consumption without distorting them? How do they navigate a publishing system that rewards sensationalism over subtlety?

Some argue the answer lies in reforming academic incentives. If journals published more null results and replication studies, the pressure to find dramatic findings would decrease. If tenure committees valued public engagement and policy relevance alongside citations, scientists could afford more nuance.

Others focus on science communication. Training researchers to convey uncertainty clearly, rather than avoiding it, could help. "We're 90% confident that X" is different from "we're certain that X"—but both can inform appropriate action.

The climate science community responded to Brown with a mix of criticism and reflection. Many noted that his specific paper was accurate, even if incomplete. The finding that climate change increases wildfire risk is well-established and important. Adding caveats about forest management wouldn't change the core conclusion.

But the broader conversation Brown sparked is valuable. Science works best when its methods and limitations are transparent. The public deserves to understand not just what scientists know, but how they know it—and what they don't yet know.

In the end, the answer isn't less climate science or more hedging. It's better communication about an inherently complex reality. The climate is changing. Human activities are responsible. The impacts are serious. These findings are robust even amid genuine uncertainty about details.

Bad faith actors will exploit any admission of uncertainty. The answer isn't to pretend certainty doesn't exist—it's to build a public discourse sophisticated enough to handle complexity. That's a challenge for scientists, journalists, and citizens alike.`

    title: "The Real Stakes of the Fight Over 'Abundance'",
    published_at: "2025-05-25",
    author: "Jonathan Chait",
    section: "ideas",
    topic: "Democracy & the American Idea",
    excerpt: "Most perversely, NEPA and similar laws have become a way to stop efforts to address climate change.",
    fullContent: `Most perversely, NEPA and similar laws have become a way to stop efforts to address climate change. The environmental movement was created during an era when activists saw their highest priority as preserving nature by stopping construction. In the era of global warming, however, preserving nature requires building new infrastructure: green energy sources, pipelines to transmit the energy, and new housing and transportation in cities where density allows for a less carbon intensive lifestyle.

Joe Biden learned this the hard way after the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. The landmark climate legislation authorized hundreds of billions in clean energy investments—but actually building the projects has proven agonizingly slow. Solar farms face years of environmental review. Transmission lines are blocked by local opposition. The very laws designed to protect the environment have become obstacles to environmental protection.

This paradox sits at the heart of contemporary climate politics. The urgency of decarbonization conflicts with the deliberation of environmental review. The need for massive infrastructure deployment clashes with place-based concerns about disruption and change.

The "abundance" movement argues that America has become too sclerotic to build. Permitting reform, they contend, is essential not just for economic growth but for climate survival. If it takes a decade to approve a transmission line, we cannot electrify fast enough to meet climate targets.

Critics worry that streamlining review would gut environmental protection. NEPA exists for good reasons—to force consideration of impacts that developers would prefer to ignore, to give communities voice in decisions that affect them. Weakening it could enable a new wave of environmental destruction.

The tension is real, but it's not irresolvable. NEPA reform can maintain environmental protection while reducing redundancy and delay. Categorical exclusions for proven clean energy technologies could accelerate deployment without sacrificing scrutiny of novel projects. Timelines for review could be shortened without eliminating review altogether.

The deeper issue is political. Environmental groups have historically opposed permitting reform, viewing it as a Trojan horse for deregulation. Industry has historically supported reform for exactly that reason. Building a coalition for climate-focused reform requires breaking this pattern.

Some environmentalists are evolving. They recognize that the status quo—where a single lawsuit can delay a wind farm for years—is incompatible with climate goals. They're willing to trade some process for more speed, as long as core protections remain.

The Biden administration attempted this balance with mixed success. Its reforms accelerated some projects while preserving community input. But litigation continues to delay major transmission lines and offshore wind farms. The infrastructure we need to decarbonize largely remains unbuilt.

What would success look like? A permitting system that enables rapid deployment of proven clean technologies while maintaining rigorous review of genuinely novel or risky projects. A system that gives communities voice without giving any individual the power to block projects of regional or national importance. A system that prioritizes the existential challenge of climate change while protecting local environments from unnecessary harm.

This is achievable. Other countries have built clean energy infrastructure faster than the United States without sacrificing environmental protection. The obstacles are political, not technical.

The climate crisis demands that we build—and build quickly. The environmental movement must evolve to embrace this reality, or risk becoming an obstacle to its own goals. The fight over abundance is really a fight over whether America can rise to the challenge of climate change. The stakes could not be higher.`
